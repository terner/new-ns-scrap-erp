# 15 Next Daily Transactions Progress

## Objective

ติดตามงานดึงหน้ากลุ่ม `รายการประจำวัน` จาก legacy source เข้าสู่ Next.js พร้อม API, DB wiring, validation, permission guard และ reconciliation เบื้องต้น

## Reporting Rule

- อัปเดตเอกสารนี้หลังจบแต่ละ batch หรือเมื่อเปลี่ยน schema/API contract
- Push git เป็นระยะหลัง validation ผ่านในแต่ละ checkpoint
- ใช้ `old-apps/legacy/` และ `old-apps/vue/` เป็น reference เท่านั้น ห้าม route/import runtime กลับไปหา legacy
- DB migration ต้องไม่ลบข้อมูลเดิม และต้องใช้ additive change เป็นค่าเริ่มต้น
- ทุกฟอร์มและ API write ต้อง validate syntax ด้วย Zod หรือ schema layer ที่ใช้ร่วมกัน
- ธุรกรรมที่กระทบเงิน/สต๊อกต้องบันทึก side effect และ reconciliation query ให้ชัด

## Batch Plan

### Batch A: Cash / Expense Foundation

Scope:
- `/daily/transfer`
- `/daily/expense`
- `/daily/petty-advance`
- `/daily/expense-dashboard`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added real Next pages and client components:
  - `/daily/transfer`
  - `/daily/expense`
  - `/daily/petty-advance`
  - `/daily/expense-dashboard`
- Done: added API routes:
  - `/api/daily/transfers`
  - `/api/daily/expenses`
  - `/api/daily/petty-advances`
  - `/api/daily/petty-advances/returns`
- Done: used existing DB tables for `transfers`, `bank_statement`, `expenses`, `expense_categories`, and `accounts`.
- Done: added missing target tables with additive migration only:
  - `petty_advances`
  - `petty_advance_returns`
- Done: preserved key legacy side effects:
  - transfer writes two deterministic `bank_statement` rows
  - paid expense writes deterministic `BS-EXP-*` bank statement row
  - petty advance writes `PADV` money-out bank statement row
  - petty advance return writes `PRET` money-in bank statement row
- Done: added frontend search/filter/sort/count for normal page use.
- Done: added server-side Zod validation for all new write APIs.
- Done: added route permission mapping for `/daily/*` and `/api/daily/*` using `finance.cash.view` during transition.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run prisma:generate --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/daily/transfer`
  - `/daily/expense`
  - `/daily/petty-advance`
  - `/daily/expense-dashboard`
  - `/api/daily/transfers`
  - `/api/daily/expenses`
  - `/api/daily/petty-advances`
  - `/api/daily/petty-advances/returns`
- Pending: authenticated browser/API smoke against Vercel/local session.

### Batch B: Payment / Receipt Operations

Scope:
- `/daily/payment-approval`
- `/purchase/payments`
- `/purchase/receipt-vouchers`
- `/sales/receipts`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: built payment approval queue from unpaid purchase bills and pending expense vouchers.
- Done: added supplier payment page/API using `payments`, `purchase_bills`, `suppliers`, and `accounts`.
- Done: added customer receipt page/API using `receipts`, `sales_bills`, `customers`, and `accounts`.
- Done: supplier payment writes deterministic `BS-PMT-*` bank statement row.
- Done: customer receipt writes deterministic `BS-RCP-*` bank statement row.
- Done: added receipt voucher read page/API using `receipt_vouchers`.
- Follow-up: approval persistence/printing is still a baseline read queue, not a full cashier approval document workflow yet.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/daily/payment-approval`
  - `/purchase/payments`
  - `/purchase/receipt-vouchers`
  - `/sales/receipts`
  - `/api/daily/payment-approval`
  - `/api/purchase/payments`
  - `/api/purchase/receipt-vouchers`
  - `/api/sales/receipts`
- Pending: AP/AR aggregate reconciliation after authenticated smoke data entry.

### Batch C: Stock Transfer and Daily Audit

Scope:
- `/stock/transfer`
- `/daily/bill-swap-history`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: implemented stock transfer page/API using existing `stock_ledger` as source of truth.
- Done: stock transfer POST creates paired `ST` stock ledger rows:
  - `โอนระหว่างสาขา-ออก`
  - `โอนระหว่างสาขา-เข้า`
- Done: implemented bill swap history read page/API using existing `bill_swap_history`.
- Follow-up: stock transfer cost currently records `unit_cost = 0` until WAC/lot cost source is confirmed for Next.
- Follow-up: cancel/void action is not implemented yet; financial/stock traceability decision is still pending.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/stock/transfer`
  - `/daily/bill-swap-history`
  - `/api/stock/transfer`
  - `/api/daily/bill-swap-history`

### Batch D: Purchase / Sales Bills

Scope:
- `/purchase/bills`
- `/sales/bills`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added read-only Next pages and APIs for purchase and sales bills.
- Done: pages read real `purchase_bills` and `sales_bills` data with supplier/customer, branch, warehouse, channel, totals, paid/received, and balances.
- Done: converted transaction list loading from frontend filtering over all rows to server-side pagination/filter/sort/count/sum for `/purchase/bills` and `/sales/bills`; default page size is 50 rows to handle monthly bill volume.
- Deferred by design: create/edit/post/void and line refactor, because they affect stock ledger, AP/AR, FIFO/COGS, and profit permissions.
- Follow-up: split header/line behavior carefully and preserve existing business flow.
- Follow-up: define reconciliation for bill count, totals, paid/received amounts, stock movements, and linked ledger rows.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build`
- Passed: server-side transaction list update validation with `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`, `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`, and `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/purchase/bills`
  - `/sales/bills`
  - `/api/purchase/bills`
  - `/api/sales/bills`

### Batch D+ Follow-up: Purchase Bill Create Modal

Scope:
- `/purchase/bills`
- `/api/purchase/bills`

Status:
- Restored purchase filter bar with search, date range, transaction mode, and source filters.
- Restored `+ บิลรับซื้อใหม่` action and added a Next modal for creating purchase bills.
- Added item rows inside the modal with `+ เพิ่มรายการ`, product selection, quantity, price, and discount.
- Added Zod syntax validation for purchase bill create payload through `purchaseBillFormSchema`.
- Added XLSX export for purchase bills.
- Follow-up update: expanded the Next purchase bill modal to mirror legacy card structure before later trimming:
  - `1. ประเภทบิล`: STOCK/TRADING, trading info, mixed Spot + PO note, Quick Load PO selector.
  - `2. ข้อมูลบิล`: doc no, supplier ref no, date, supplier, branch, warehouse, purchase channel, license plate, contact phone, salesperson, source, VAT mode.
  - `3. รายการสินค้า`: product, display name, per-line PO, gross weight, tare/deduct weight, net weight, price, salesperson display price, discount, line amount.
  - `4. VAT & ยอดรวม`: VAT toggle, bill-level discount, total weight, subtotal, after-discount, VAT, grand total.
  - VAT invoice tracking: received flag, VAT invoice no, VAT invoice date.
  - Notes card.
- Follow-up update: `/api/purchase/bills` now accepts and stores legacy-compatible header fields on `purchase_bills` and line fields inside `items` JSON:
  - `po_buy_id`, `license_plate`, `contact_phone`, `sales_id`, `discount_total`, `vat_invoice_received`, `vat_invoice_no`, `vat_invoice_date`, `note`
  - item `displayName`, `poBuyId`, `grossWeight`, `deductWeight`, `qty` as net weight, `salesPrice`
- Follow-up update: options payload now includes active/open PO buys and active salespersons for the create modal.

Important boundary:
- Current create path writes `purchase_bills` header + `items` JSON and AP balance fields only.
- It intentionally does not write `stock_ledger`, WAC/FIFO, AP payment links, or posting/void side effects yet. Those need a separate reconciliation-backed transaction batch.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`

### Batch E: Pending Sale / Stock Issue

Scope:
- `/sales/stock-issue`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added read-only Next page/API for `stock_issues`.
- Deferred by design: create/post/convert-to-bill flow until sales bill and stock ledger write rules are reconciled.
- Follow-up: reconcile issued stock against later sales invoice links.

Validation:
- Passed with Batch D validation above.
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/sales/stock-issue`
  - `/api/sales/stock-issue`

## Current Status as of 2026-05-18

- Current git checkpoint before daily work: `65a42bc fix: simplify payment and remittance masters`.
- Planning checkpoint: `3b32499 docs: plan next daily transactions`.
- Batch A implementation checkpoint: `24ab600 feat: add daily cash expense baseline`.
- Batch B implementation checkpoint: `64bcde3 feat: add daily payment receipt baseline`.
- Batch C implementation checkpoint pending commit after this doc update.
- Batch C implementation checkpoint: `32ff488 feat: add daily stock transfer audit baseline`.
- Batch D/E read baseline checkpoint pending commit after this doc update.
- Next daily Batch A routes now have real Next pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch B payment/receipt routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch C stock transfer/audit routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch D/E transaction read routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Legacy daily UI/reference exists under:
  - `old-apps/legacy/index.html`
  - `old-apps/vue/src/views/daily/`
- Prisma already has target models for:
  - `transfers`
  - `bank_statement`
  - `expenses`
  - `payments`
  - `receipts`
  - `bill_swap_history`
- Petty advance target tables added in `dev-target` and migration file:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260518052409_create_petty_advance_tables.sql`
  - Prisma models: `petty_advances`, `petty_advance_returns`

## Open Decisions

- Whether daily write permissions should use one temporary `finance.cash.manage` permission or split into transfer/expense/payment-specific permissions.
- Whether delete actions in legacy should become cancel/void actions in Next for financial traceability. Batch A currently avoids destructive delete actions.
- Petty advance `spent` is currently `0` in Next baseline until expense-to-advance allocation is wired.
- Payment approval persistence/print sheet is not fully ported yet; current Batch B is an actionable queue/read surface plus payment/receipt write APIs.
- Stock transfer uses `stock_ledger` directly; no separate header table has been created yet.
- Purchase/sales bill pages are intentionally read baseline only. Write/post behavior is deferred until transaction reconciliation and line-table design are explicit.
