# 15 Next Daily Transactions Progress

## Objective

ติดตามงานดึงหน้ากลุ่ม `รายการประจำวัน` จาก legacy source เข้าสู่ Next.js พร้อม API, DB wiring, validation, permission guard และ reconciliation เบื้องต้น

## Reporting Rule

- อัปเดตเอกสารนี้หลังจบแต่ละ batch หรือเมื่อเปลี่ยน schema/API contract
- Push git เป็นระยะหลัง validation ผ่านในแต่ละ checkpoint
- ใช้ `old-apps/legacy/` และ `old-apps/vue/` เป็น reference เท่านั้น ห้าม route/import runtime กลับไปหา legacy
- DB migration ต้องไม่ลบข้อมูลเดิม และต้องใช้ additive change เป็นค่าเริ่มต้น
- ทุกฟอร์มและ API write ต้อง validate syntax ด้วย Zod หรือ schema layer ที่ใช้ร่วมกัน
- ธุรกรรมที่กระทบเงิน/สต๊อกต้องบันทึก side effect และ reconciliation query ให้ชัด

## Batch Plan

### Batch A: Cash / Expense Foundation

Scope:
- `/daily/transfer`
- `/daily/expense`
- `/daily/petty-advance`
- `/daily/expense-dashboard`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added real Next pages and client components:
  - `/daily/transfer`
  - `/daily/expense`
  - `/daily/petty-advance`
  - `/daily/expense-dashboard`
- Done: added API routes:

### Batch B: Payment / Receipt Operations

Scope:
- `/daily/payment-approval`
- `/purchase/payments`
- `/purchase/receipt-vouchers`
- `/sales/receipts`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: built payment approval queue from unpaid purchase bills and pending expense vouchers.
- Done: added supplier payment page/API using `payments`, `purchase_bills`, `suppliers`, and `accounts`.
- Done: added customer receipt page/API using `receipts`, `sales_bills`, `customers`, and `accounts`.
- Done: supplier payment writes deterministic `BS-PMT-*` bank statement row.
- Done: customer receipt writes deterministic `BS-RCP-*` bank statement row.
- Done: added receipt voucher read page/API using `receipt_vouchers`.
- Done on 2026-05-27: added persistent `payment_approvals` snapshot flow for AP purchase bills.
- Done on 2026-05-27: `/daily/payment-approval` now writes approval snapshots and returns persisted `pending`/`approved` rows instead of UI-only selection state.
- Done on 2026-05-27: `/purchase/payments` now reads approved snapshots only and links payment rows back with `payments.payment_approval_id`.
- Done on 2026-05-27: approved AP rows become read-only in the approval UI and supplier-payment bank display prefers approval snapshot over supplier master live fields.
- Updated on 2026-05-28: `/purchase/payments` is the active queue surface and each approved row now has `ทำจ่าย` and `ยกเลิก`. This `ยกเลิก` cancels the queued payment item before payment and returns the bill to `/daily/payment-approval`.
- Updated on 2026-05-28: payment history remains read-only, but the business model is now “one payment item, many statuses”. Snapshot history must keep cancelled rows too, not only successful posted vouchers.
- Done on 2026-05-28: `/api/purchase/payment-history` now includes `payment_approvals.status='voided'` rows with no linked payments as `ยกเลิกแล้ว` snapshots, so cancelling a queued payment item from `/purchase/payments` produces visible history without fabricating a payment row.
- Done on 2026-05-28: `payment_approvals` now separates UUID `id` from user-facing `doc_no`. Approval snapshots use `PMA{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN`, and each new approval cycle must create a new `PMA` number. Cancelled approval snapshots stay in history as their own rows with status `ยกเลิกแล้ว`; re-approving the same bill later must create a fresh approval snapshot with a fresh `PMA`, not reuse the old `doc_no`.
- Done on 2026-05-28: local dev-target applied `20260528190000_restore_payment_approval_doc_no_unique.sql`. Duplicate PMA rows from the temporary reuse experiment were renumbered safely and `payment_approvals.doc_no` is unique again at the database level.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: re-approving after `ยกเลิกรายการรอจ่าย` must rebuild the approval snapshot from current `purchase_bills` + current selected destination bank account, not by cloning the cancelled `payment_approvals` row.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: the `ยังไม่อนุมัติ` queue is live data, not snapshot data. Editing a purchase bill before approval must update the queue immediately, and any approval created after a cancel must still snapshot from the latest bill state.
- New follow-up on 2026-05-28: enforce purchase-bill locking after approval. `PATCH /api/purchase/bills` must reject edits while an active `payment_approvals.status='approved'` or active payment exists, and only reopen editing after the queued payment item is cancelled and the bill returns to pending approval.
- New follow-up on 2026-05-28: `/purchase/bills` needs a complete payment-workflow segmented filter. The purchase list must expose and filter at least `ยังไม่อนุมัติ`, `รอจ่าย`, `ชำระบางส่วน`, `เสร็จสิ้น`, and `ยกเลิก`, with `ชำระบางส่วน` derived from real payment activity while `payable_balance` still remains.
- Open batch on 2026-05-28: finish `/purchase/bills` payment-workflow segmented filter implementation. API and UI must share one state model and derive order: `cancelled`, `paid`, `partial_paid`, `pending_payment`, `pending_approval`. Verification target is browser filtering for all 5 states plus correct edit-lock behavior.
- New analysis/design batch on 2026-05-28: add `advance payment / deposit` support to Purchase Flow. Needed behavior: create advance-payment transactions before final purchase bill, then let `/purchase/bills` select and allocate those advance entries so the bill’s remaining payable is reduced before it enters `/daily/payment-approval`.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: after creating a purchase bill with allocated advance payments, the bill should stay `ยังไม่อนุมัติ` only when net payable remains. If advances fully cover the bill, the bill should become `เสร็จสิ้น` immediately and skip payment approval.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: over-advance is not treated as carry-forward supplier credit in the target system right now. Excess advance above the final bill amount must be refunded first; using it to offset another bill stays outside the system for now.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: this over-advance refund must live in a Supplier-specific refund flow/menu, not in the customer/sales refund menu.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: advance-payment creation must support large-scale source fields (large-scale doc no, in/out dates, plate, optional vehicle photo, customer, product, in/out/net weights, price per kg, operator/sender/driver, and advance amount). The resulting advance-payment item must then enter the same approval queue, which should now be named `อนุมัติจ่ายเงิน`.
- Clarified on 2026-05-28: this approval surface must be treated as `อนุมัติจ่ายเงิน` conceptually because one queue now needs to accept `บิลรับซื้อ`, `จ่ายเงินล่วงหน้า / มัดจำ`, and `ค่าใช้จ่าย`.
- New requirement on 2026-05-28: approval must support split items in one cycle. A single payable source can be split into many approval rows by payment method/account; each split must create its own `payment_approvals` row and then appear as its own queued row in `/purchase/payments`.
- Documentation split on 2026-05-28: `docs/notes/Payment Flow.md` is now the canonical note for payment approval, queued payment items, payment history, advance payment, and supplier advance-refund rules. `docs/notes/Purchase Flow.md` remains canonical for purchase-side source documents and bill-state rules.
- Implementation slice on 2026-05-28: `/purchase/advance-payments` now starts the active `ADV` document surface for supplier deposit / advance payment capture. The first additive DB slice creates `supplier_advance_payments` and `supplier_advance_allocations`, and the page/API captures Supplier, branch, payment method/account intent, amount, and large-scale source fields. Approval queue ingestion, payment posting, purchase-bill allocation, and supplier refund remain follow-up tasks.
- Vehicle-photo input follow-up on 2026-05-29: `/purchase/advance-payments` now uses a browser file picker for `รูปภาพรถ` instead of a URL textbox. This slice stores selected filenames in `supplier_advance_payments.vehicle_photo_names`; it does not upload binaries to Supabase Storage yet.
- Open task batch on 2026-05-28 for approval-item implementation:
  - rename active wording/menu to `อนุมัติจ่ายเงิน`
  - add advance-payment source documents into the same queue design
  - redesign `/daily/payment-approval` so one source row can produce many split approval items
  - update `/api/daily/payment-approval` to persist one row per split item
  - update `/purchase/payments` to operate at approval-item level
  - verify bill lock/unlock semantics when some split items are cancelled or paid
- New documentation follow-up on 2026-05-28: `docs/notes/Purchase Flow.md` now needs to be treated as the canonical state/use-case matrix for purchase AP flow, covering at least `ยังไม่อนุมัติ`, `รอจ่าย`, `ยกเลิกรายการรอจ่าย`, `อนุมัติใหม่`, `จ่ายสำเร็จ`, and the resulting edit/cancel lock rules on purchase bills.
- Done smoke on 2026-05-27: local browser/API path verified `PB012605-0035 -> PMA012605-0001 -> PMT012605-0291`; after payment the approval row left both `/daily/payment-approval` and `/purchase/payments`, DB showed `payment_approvals.status='paid'`, and `purchase_bills.payable_balance` reached `0`.
- Done on 2026-05-27: purchase flow is now treated as closed through supplier payment history for the AP purchase-bill path. The next batch should verify inbound-stock behavior end-to-end: `WTI -> Purchase Bill -> stock_ledger -> stock balance`, plus `cancel Purchase Bill -> reverse stock`.
- Done on 2026-05-27: created `docs/notes/Purchase Flow Test Matrix.md` as the dedicated QA/UAT checklist for Purchase Flow. Use this note for executing and recording use cases instead of expanding `Purchase Flow.md`, which remains the business/dependency decision document.
- New follow-up batch required on 2026-05-28 for purchase payment history hardening:
  - Done baseline: history page now includes explicit status filters (`ทั้งหมด`, `เสร็จสิ้น`, `ยกเลิกแล้ว`).
  - Done baseline: history remains read-only.
  - Follow-up: make cancelled queue items from `/purchase/payments` persist into the same history surface as `ยกเลิกแล้ว` snapshots.
  - Follow-up: keep any later re-approve/re-pay as a new voucher/payment row rather than overwrite the cancelled one.
  - Follow-up: audit downstream accounting/bank-posting/report queries and confirm they consume only successful payment rows everywhere, not just in the purchase-payment surfaces.
- Remaining follow-up block for payment approval workflow:
  - Expense-side approval write flow is still not enabled; `/api/daily/payment-approval` currently rejects expense approvals on purpose.
  - Complete the payment-history cancellation path so voucher rollback also updates history UI/status cleanly after approval state rollback.
  - Add print payload/view for `ใบอนุมัติโอนเงิน` from approval snapshot.
  - Add browser smoke for `void guard` and `paid guard` once the void path exists.
  - Legacy compare checkpoint (from `old-apps/legacy/index.html`):
    - Legacy stores approvals in `db.paymentApprovals`.
    - Legacy row shape is minimal: `id`, `refType`, `refId`, `approvedAmount`, `status`, `approvedBy`, `approvedAt`, `note`.
    - Legacy supports direct `unapprove()` by deleting the approval row; target policy is stricter and should not expose unapprove as a normal user path.
    - Legacy print sheet reads live supplier bank account fields; target policy must upgrade this to snapshot-driven printing.

### Batch C: Stock Transfer and Daily Audit

Scope:
- `/stock/transfer`
- `/daily/bill-swap-history`

Status: Done baseline on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: implemented stock transfer page/API using existing `stock_ledger` as source of truth.
- Done: stock transfer POST creates paired `ST` stock ledger rows:
  - `โอนระหว่างสาขา-ออก`
  - `โอนระหว่างสาขา-เข้า`
- Done: implemented bill swap history read page/API using existing `bill_swap_history`.
- Follow-up: stock transfer cost currently records `unit_cost = 0` until WAC/lot cost source is confirmed for Next.
- Follow-up: cancel/void action is not implemented yet; financial/stock traceability decision is still pending.

### Batch D: Purchase / Sales Bills

Scope:
- `/purchase/bills`
- `/sales/bills`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added read-only Next pages and APIs for purchase and sales bills.
- Done: pages read real `purchase_bills` and `sales_bills` data with supplier/customer, branch, warehouse, channel, totals, paid/received, and balances.
- Done: converted transaction list loading from frontend filtering over all rows to server-side pagination/filter/sort/count/sum for `/purchase/bills` and `/sales/bills`; default page size is 50 rows to handle monthly bill volume.
- Deferred by design: create/edit/post/void and line refactor, because they affect stock ledger, AP/AR, FIFO/COGS, and profit permissions.
- Follow-up: split header/line behavior carefully and preserve existing business flow.
- Follow-up: define reconciliation for bill count, totals, paid/received amounts, stock movements, and linked ledger rows.

- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build`

  - `/purchase/bills`
  - `/sales/bills`
  - `/api/purchase/bills`
  - `/api/sales/bills`

### Batch D+ Follow-up: Purchase Bill Create Modal

Scope:
- `/purchase/bills`
- `/api/purchase/bills`

Status:
- Restored purchase filter bar with search, date range, transaction mode, and source filters.
- Restored `+ บิลรับซื้อใหม่` action and added a Next modal for creating purchase bills.
- Added item rows inside the modal with `+ เพิ่มรายการ`, product selection, quantity, price, and discount.
- Added Zod syntax validation for purchase bill create payload through `purchaseBillFormSchema`.
- Added XLSX export for purchase bills.
- Follow-up update: expanded the Next purchase bill modal to mirror legacy card structure before later trimming:
  - `1. ประเภทบิล`: STOCK/TRADING, trading info, mixed Spot + PO note, Quick Load PO selector.
  - `2. ข้อมูลบิล`: doc no, supplier ref no, date, supplier, branch, warehouse, purchase channel, license plate, contact phone, salesperson, source, VAT mode.
  - `3. รายการสินค้า`: product, display name, per-line PO, gross weight, tare/deduct weight, net weight, price, salesperson display price, discount, line amount.
  - `4. VAT & ยอดรวม`: VAT toggle, bill-level discount, total weight, subtotal, after-discount, VAT, grand total.
  - VAT invoice tracking: received flag, VAT invoice no, VAT invoice date.
  - Notes card.
- Follow-up update: `/api/purchase/bills` now accepts and stores legacy-compatible header fields on `purchase_bills` and line fields inside `items` JSON:
  - `po_buy_id`, `license_plate`, `contact_phone`, `sales_id`, `discount_total`, `vat_invoice_received`, `vat_invoice_no`, `vat_invoice_date`, `note`
  - item `displayName`, `poBuyId`, `grossWeight`, `deductWeight`, `qty` as net weight, `salesPrice`
- Follow-up update: options payload now includes active/open PO buys and active salespersons for the create modal.
- Follow-up update: purchase bill document number is no longer user-editable in the create modal. `/api/purchase/bills` now generates `PB{branchCode}{YYMM}-{runningNo}` at save time only inside a DB transaction, uses `pg_advisory_xact_lock` to serialize new purchase bill number assignment, returns the generated `docNo`, and retries on `doc_no` unique conflict.
- Follow-up update: purchase bill document number format now includes branch code. Branch codes are normalized as `01 = สมุทรสาคร` and `02 = นครสวรรค์`, so examples look like `PB012605-3074`. The running number continues from the highest purchase bill running number in that month, including both old `PB2605-####` and new `PB012605-####`/`PB022605-####` formats.
- Follow-up update: added additive unique indexes for `purchase_bills.doc_no` and `sales_bills.doc_no`. Migration fails fast if duplicate document numbers already exist; it does not delete or merge data. Dev-target purchase bills were reconciled on 2026-05-18 by backing up all current rows, setting all current purchase bills to `BR002/WH002` (สมุทรสาคร), and renumbering them to unique `PB012605-0001` through `PB012605-0409`; unique indexes were then applied successfully.
- Follow-up update: purchase bill table rows now open `/purchase/bills/[id]` detail page. Detail page reads `supplier_id` as the FK and displays supplier name from master data relation `suppliers.name`; transaction rows should keep FK/id and not store ad hoc supplier display text as the source of truth.
- Follow-up update: purchase bills can now be edited from the `/purchase/bills` table even when supplier payments already exist. This intentionally differs from the old legacy lock rule. Edit keeps existing `payments` untouched, recomputes `paid_amount`, `payable_balance`, and `status` from payment rows, and regenerates `stock_ledger.ref_type = PB` for `STOCK` bills only.

Important boundary:
- Current create/edit path writes `purchase_bills` header + `purchase_bill_items` relational line rows, updates AP balance fields, and writes `stock_ledger` rows for `STOCK` bills. The old `purchase_bills.items` JSONB column has been removed from the target schema.
- Product master now exposes the stock receipt status (`products.item_status`) as `รับเข้าเป็น` with RM/WIP/FG/SCRAP choices. Purchase bill `STOCK` create/edit reads that value per line, auto-picks a matching branch warehouse by status hint, and stamps PB stock ledger rows with that status in `output_category`.
- Warehouse master now has `warehouses.type` with RM/WIP/FG/SCRAP choices, so each branch can maintain separate stock locations such as สมุทรสาคร RM and สมุทรสาคร FG. Purchase bill stock routing prefers warehouse type before falling back to legacy code/name hints.
- DB migration apply is pending. `supabase migration list --db-url "$SUPABASE_DB_URL"` on 2026-05-23 showed remote-only migration `20260519044843` plus multiple local-only migration history gaps, so dev-target needs migration history repair/pull before `20260523000100_add_warehouse_type.sql` can be pushed cleanly.
- `TRADING` remains a PB document but does not create stock ledger.
- Purchase flow requirement clarified on 2026-05-25: inbound weighing/receiving is the business `ใบรับของ / Weight Ticket In` with document number `WTI{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN` for Stock purchases only. Outbound delivery uses `ใบส่งของ / Weight Ticket Out` with document number `WTO{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN`. There is no plain `WT` document number. Stock purchase bills must come from `WTI` and may be PO or Spot/No PO; Trading purchase bills do not use `WTI`, require quantity/weight entry in `/purchase/bills`, do not create stock ledger, and cut PO only for Trading + PO. The target design must support many-to-many allocation: one `WTI` can cut multiple PO, and one PO can have multiple `WTI`.
- Purchase bill stock form follow-up on 2026-05-25: `/purchase/bills` now treats the selected `WTI` as a locked upstream context. After choosing WTI in `STOCK`, the form disables `ประเภทบิล`, `สาขา`, `ผู้ขาย`, and `ใบรับของ`; users must explicitly click `ล้างใบรับของ` to reset downstream data before changing those fields. This replaces the older silent-reset behavior that risked inconsistent form state.
- Purchase bill pricing follow-up on 2026-05-25: in the `รายการจากใบรับของ` table, choosing `PO Buy` now auto-fills `ราคา/กก.` from `po_buys.unit_price` and locks the price field against manual edits. Choosing `Spot Buy` leaves the price editable. The same WTI table no longer renders a line-level discount field; stock receipt lines calculate row totals directly from `qty * price`, while only `ส่วนลดท้ายบิล` remains editable at the bill level.
- Purchase bill WTI allocation update on 2026-05-26: after moving receipt sourcing to `WTI product summaries`, `/purchase/bills` now supports split-allocation within one product summary. One `receiptSummaryId` can expand into multiple bill rows, users see in-form PO remaining after draft allocations, and can continue the same WTI product with another `PO` or `Spot Buy`. Business rule was then clarified further: `Spot Buy` must not force the remaining WTI weight to be billed in the same purchase bill. Partial save is valid, and the system should only block over-allocation against WTI remaining or PO remaining; WTI state then moves among `รับของแล้ว`, `ออกบิลแล้วบางส่วน`, and `เสร็จสิ้น` according to real active-bill usage.
- Purchase bill allocation/data-model checkpoint on 2026-05-26: the next schema step was completed. `purchase_bill_receipt_allocations` and `purchase_bill_po_allocations` now exist as explicit fact tables for WTI-summary usage and PO cuts; `/api/purchase/bills` create/edit/cancel writes them and refreshes WTI from those facts. `/purchase/bills/[id]` now renders `สรุปต่อสินค้า` above `รายละเอียด allocation รายแถว` and shows explicit trace from WTI document, WTI summary, and PO/Spot source.
- PO Buy hardening checkpoint on 2026-05-26: `/purchase/po-buy` now reconciles header remaining/status from active `purchase_bill_po_allocations`, not only cached header values. Additive schema now includes short-close metadata on `po_buys` and append-only `po_buy_status_logs`. The UI/API support `ปิดรับไม่ครบ`, expose the new status in filters/detail, and show status history in the detail modal. `/api/purchase/bills` now reconciles referenced PO before validate/save and after create/edit/cancel, so fully used or short-closed PO stop appearing in PO selection immediately.
- Browser smoke on 2026-05-26: authenticated local-browser verification passed for `WTI -> PB partial`, `WTI -> multiple PB`, and `cancel PB -> recalc WTI`. The tested local path used `WTI012605-0002`, created `PB012605-0415` (PO partial) and `PB012605-0416` (Spot partial), verified WTI state/doc references after each save, then cancelled both PBs and confirmed WTI returned to `รับของแล้ว`.
- WTI status wording update on 2026-05-26: inbound `WTI` no longer collapses partial/full billing together in the UI. The list/detail flow now treats `received = รับของแล้ว`, `partially_billed = ออกบิลแล้วบางส่วน`, and `billed = เสร็จสิ้น` as separate states so office can distinguish usable partial receipts from fully billed receipts.
- Purchase bill cancel behavior update on 2026-05-26: PB cancel now has an explicit design rule in docs. The intended behavior is status+stock reversal plus receipt recalculation, not field-by-field writeback. After cancelling a PB with no payments, the system should recalculate referenced `WTI` and `weight_ticket_product_summaries` from the remaining active purchase bills so receipts move back to `รับของแล้ว`, `ออกบิลแล้วบางส่วน`, or stay `เสร็จสิ้น` according to real remaining usage.
- WTI data-layer implementation follow-up on 2026-05-26: `WTI/WTO` now has a concrete repo-level three-layer design and implementation path. New schema objects `weight_ticket_product_summaries` and `weight_ticket_product_summary_lines` were added to Prisma plus migration SQL `20260526103000_create_weight_ticket_product_summaries.sql` with backfill logic from existing `weight_ticket_lines`. `/api/daily/weight-tickets` now rebuilds per-product summaries on save/update, and `/api/purchase/bills` now reads/validates `WTI` by summary rows so same-product lots in one receipt become one operational purchase-bill row with aggregated weight. Remaining operational gap: this migration has not yet been applied to the active `dev-target` DB from the current shell because the local Supabase CLI context is not linked to that project.
- WTI/WTO persistence update on 2026-05-25: `/daily/weight-tickets` now writes real records to `/api/daily/weight-tickets` backed by `public.weight_tickets` and `public.weight_ticket_lines`. Document number, document date/time, and entered-by are still generated on save only. `/daily/weight-ticket-list` now reads the real API, no longer uses sample/localStorage fallback rows, and supports detail modal actions `แก้ไข` / `ยกเลิก` until the document is referenced by purchase/sales bill allocation.
- WTI/WTO vehicle-image follow-up on 2026-05-25: the form now places `รูปภาพรถส่งของ` beside `ทะเบียนรถ`, stores vehicle image names separately from product-line image names in persisted weight-ticket tables, opens newly uploaded images in a preview dialog, keeps existing filenames visible during edit, and hides the deduction value input when the line deduction mode is `ไม่หัก`.
- WTI/WTO DB hotfix on 2026-05-25: after confirming runtime error `42P01 relation "public.weight_tickets" does not exist`, additive SQL `supabase/migrations/20260525103000_create_weight_tickets.sql` was applied directly to the active dev DB so `/api/daily/weight-tickets` can load successfully.
- Sales-side WTO design follow-up on 2026-05-26: `docs/notes/Sales Flow.md` now treats `WTO` as the outbound source document on the sales side with a dedicated sequence `WTO -> Sales Bill -> Receipt`, an explicit use-case map, and the target business statuses `ส่งของแล้ว`, `ออกบิลแล้ว`, and `ยกเลิก`. Once a `WTO` is used to create a sales bill, the target policy is to lock edit/cancel and show `ออกบิลแล้ว`.
- WTI mobile form stability follow-up on 2026-05-26: `/daily/weight-tickets` no longer generates a random first-line id during SSR, preventing hydration mismatch in searchable product fields. Shared input/select/combobox primitives now use a touch-safe mobile font baseline, uploaded image filenames are truncated to avoid stretching the mobile form, and the impurity deduction-mode control has been moved off the browser-native select path so spacing/trigger behavior can be tuned in line with the shared dropdown pattern.
- Cost Pool clarification on 2026-05-25: only copper/brass products (`ทองแดง`, `ทองเหลือง`, `copper`, `brass`) enter Cost Pool. PO Buy needs a `ปิดรับไม่ครบ` action for short delivery; it must remove/release only the remaining undelivered eligible quantity from Cost Pool candidate/availability and preserve actual received/billed stock rows.
- Purchase bill document remains editable after supplier payments exist by current business decision. Existing payment rows are preserved and AP balance/status is recomputed from current payment totals.
- Existing supplier payments are not rewritten by purchase-bill edit. If totals change after payment, AP balance is recalculated from current payment rows.
- Full void/reversal and PO remaining-qty reconciliation still need a separate transaction batch.

### Batch E: Pending Sale / Stock Issue

Scope:
- `/sales/stock-issue`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added read-only Next page/API for `stock_issues`.

### Batch F: Purchase Bill Linked Flow Surfaces

Scope:
- `/finance/ap`
- `/stock/ledger`
- `/trading/matching`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added AP aging page/API from legacy `view-ap` behavior using `purchase_bills` + `payments`.
- Done: AP API computes live paid amount from supplier payments instead of trusting stale `paid_amount` only.
- Done: added Stock Ledger page/API from legacy `view-stockLedger` read surface, defaulting the UI to `refType = PB` so purchase-bill movements are visible first.
- Done: added Trading Matching page/API from legacy `view-tradingMatching` read surface using `purchase_bills.transaction_mode = TRADING`, `sales_bills.transaction_mode = TRADING`, and `trading_deals`.
- Done: added route/API permission mapping for `/api/finance/*`, `/api/stock/*`, `/api/trading/*`, `/finance/*`, `/stock/*`, and `/trading/*`.

Important boundary:
- These three pages are DB-connected read surfaces first. They intentionally do not create approval records, stock reversals, trading deals, or edit existing bills yet.
- Purchase bill create now posts `stock_ledger.ref_type = PB` only for `transaction_mode = STOCK`; `TRADING` remains a PB document but does not create stock ledger.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Build confirmed routes generated:

### Batch G: PO Buy and Outstanding Flow Surfaces

Scope:
- `/purchase/po-buy`
- `/po-reports/outstanding`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added PO Buy page/API from legacy `view-poBuy` read surface using real `po_buys`, suppliers, and product lookups.
- Done: PO Buy page separates delivery PO from costing-only PO via `require_delivery`.
- Done: added PO Outstanding page/API from legacy `view-poOutstanding` read surface using `po_buys` and `po_sells`.
- Done: PO Outstanding excludes `require_delivery = false` rows, matching legacy behavior where costing-only PO does not enter outstanding delivery tracking.
- Done: added permission mapping for `/api/po-reports/*`.

Important boundary:
- These pages are DB-connected read surfaces first. Create/edit/toggle between Delivery and Costing-only still needs a separate write batch with validation, audit, and purchase-bill cut reconciliation.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/purchase/po-buy`
  - `/po-reports/outstanding`
  - `/api/purchase/po-buy`
  - `/api/po-reports/outstanding`

### Batch H: Supplier Tracking Surface

Scope:
- `/tracking/supplier`

Status: Read baseline done on 2026-05-18.

Tasks:
- Done: added Supplier Tracking page/API from legacy `view-supplierTracking`.
- Done: API reads real `suppliers`, `purchase_bills`, and `payments`.
- Done: supports year/month query, monthly purchase trend, supplier totals, paid amount, payable balance, average buy price, and bill/payment counts.
- Done: added route/API permission mapping for `/tracking/*` and `/api/tracking/*`.

Important boundary:
- This is a DB-connected read surface. It does not yet include detail drilldown/export XLSX or product breakdown modal from legacy.

Validation:
- Passed: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Passed: `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/tracking/supplier`
  - `/api/tracking/supplier`
- Deferred by design: create/post/convert-to-bill flow until sales bill and stock ledger write rules are reconciled.
- Follow-up: reconcile issued stock against later sales invoice links.

Validation:
- Passed with Batch D validation above.
- Build confirmed routes generated:
  - `/sales/stock-issue`
  - `/api/sales/stock-issue`

## Current Status as of 2026-05-18

- Current git checkpoint before daily work: `65a42bc fix: simplify payment and remittance masters`.
- Planning checkpoint: `3b32499 docs: plan next daily transactions`.
- Batch A implementation checkpoint: `24ab600 feat: add daily cash expense baseline`.
- Batch B implementation checkpoint: `64bcde3 feat: add daily payment receipt baseline`.
- Batch C implementation checkpoint pending commit after this doc update.
- Batch C implementation checkpoint: `32ff488 feat: add daily stock transfer audit baseline`.
- Batch D/E read baseline checkpoint pending commit after this doc update.
- Next daily Batch A routes now have real Next pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch B payment/receipt routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch C stock transfer/audit routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Next daily Batch D/E transaction read routes now have baseline pages and API routes.
- Purchase bill create/edit flow now writes header + relational line items in `purchase_bill_items`, generates branch/month document numbers at save time, recalculates AP status from payments, and writes stock ledger only for `STOCK` bills. The old `purchase_bills.items` JSONB column has been removed from the target schema. The modal reads the active VAT percent from `vat_settings`, displays that percent in the VAT summary, calculates with that rate, and stores the applied percent in `purchase_bills.vat_rate_percent`.
- Supplier payment save now refreshes the linked purchase bill AP fields in the same transaction: `paid_amount`, `payable_balance`, and `status` are recomputed from active `payments` rows by `bill_id`; overpayment is rejected and edits that move a payment to another bill refresh both old and new bills. Data dictionary updated at `docs/data-dictionary/purchase-bills.md`, and a dev-target schema-only snapshot was dumped to `reports/db_audit/dev_target_schema_20260522.sql`.
- Purchase bill linked read surfaces now exist for AP aging, stock ledger, trading matching, PO buy, outstanding PO, and supplier tracking.
- Legacy daily UI/reference exists under:
  - `old-apps/legacy/index.html`
  - `old-apps/vue/src/views/daily/`
- Prisma already has target models for:
  - `transfers`
  - `bank_statement`
  - `expenses`
  - `payments`
  - `receipts`
  - `bill_swap_history`
- Petty advance target tables added in `dev-target` and migration file:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260518052409_create_petty_advance_tables.sql`
  - Prisma models: `petty_advances`, `petty_advance_returns`

## Open Decisions

- Whether daily write permissions should use one temporary `finance.cash.manage` permission or split into transfer/expense/payment-specific permissions.
- Whether delete actions in legacy should become cancel/void actions in Next for financial traceability. Batch A currently avoids destructive delete actions.
- Petty advance `spent` is currently `0` in Next baseline until expense-to-advance allocation is wired.
- Payment approval persistence/print sheet is not fully ported yet; current Batch B is an actionable queue/read surface plus payment/receipt write APIs.
- Stock transfer uses `stock_ledger` directly; no separate header table has been created yet.
- Sales bill page remains read baseline. Purchase bill create/edit is active baseline but full void/reversal, PO remaining-qty reconciliation, and header/line table refactor are still pending.
- Whether purchase bill edit after payment should stay unrestricted in UAT, or require audit/re-approval for finance control.
