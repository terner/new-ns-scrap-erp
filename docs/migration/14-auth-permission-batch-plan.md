# 14 Auth Permission Batch Plan

## Objective

วาง batch งาน login, reset password, user management, role/permission และ access enforcement ของ Next app โดยยึด Supabase Auth เป็น source of truth และใช้ legacy behavior เป็น baseline เฉพาะ business permission เท่านั้น

## Reporting Rule

- อัปเดตเอกสารนี้หลังจบทุก auth/permission batch
- อัปเดตทันทีเมื่อ schema, route guard, API guard, RLS, reset-password flow หรือ role matrix เปลี่ยน
- บันทึก validation ทุกครั้งหลังรัน lint, type-check, build, smoke test หรือ auth flow test
- ห้ามบันทึก password, token, service role key หรือข้อมูล credential จริงลงเอกสาร
- ทุก schema migration ต้อง additive/non-destructive ก่อน UAT และห้ามลบข้อมูลเดิม

## Login Flow Verification 2026-07-12

- Local authenticated smoke test passed against the configured local Supabase environment: `/login` accepted the active email/password account, established the SSR cookie session, redirected to `/owner-daily`, and `GET /api/auth/me` returned HTTP 200 with the linked active `app_users` record, role `system_admin`, and 38 permission codes.
- Local unauthenticated contract passed: `/owner-daily` redirected to `/login?redirect=%2Fowner-daily`, while `GET /api/auth/me` returned HTTP 401 with `กรุณาเข้าสู่ระบบ`.
- Logout smoke test passed: the account menu called Supabase `signOut`, returned the browser to `/login`, and the subsequent `GET /api/auth/me` returned HTTP 401.
- Current login UI accepts email only. Historical username-login notes below describe an older implementation and must not be treated as the current runtime contract.
- Resolved hardening: migration `20260712120000_add_current_app_user_access_context.sql` adds the authenticated security-definer RPC `current_app_user_access_context()`. The proxy uses this RPC as its single active-app-user source because direct `app_users` reads are intentionally restricted by RLS; RPC and permission-read errors now return HTTP 500 instead of being converted into a normal 403/login redirect.
- Resolved hardening: `AppShell` now redirects HTTP 401 to login and presents explicit 403/500/network errors. It no longer fabricates an empty role/permission context when `/api/auth/me` fails.
- Resolved hardening: password login must complete `POST /api/auth/login-complete`, which validates the Prisma application-user context and records the successful login audit before navigation. A missing/inactive app user or server failure signs out the local Supabase session and displays an explicit error.
- Invalid credentials now use a stable Thai message instead of exposing the raw Supabase provider error.
- Dev-target migration apply passed for project `fhglqymcdmrgbsbadnwr`. Post-fix browser smoke passed invalid-password handling, `login-complete = 200`, `/api/auth/me = 200`, role `system_admin`, 38 permission codes, protected landing, logout, and post-logout `/api/auth/me = 401`.
- Validation passed: Next type-check, lint with one pre-existing unrelated `qa-thai-font.tsx` warning, production build, and `git diff --check`.

## Current Status as of 2026-05-18

- Next login page exists at `/login`.
- Login currently uses Supabase Auth email/password through `@supabase/ssr`.
- Next `proxy.ts` protects pages/API with `supabase.auth.getUser()`.
- Current route/API gate is admin-only:
  - reads `public.user_profiles.role`
  - falls back to Supabase user metadata role
  - requires role `admin` and active profile
- Logout exists in the top auth status component.
- Password visibility toggle exists on the login password field.
- Full reset-password flow is not implemented yet.
- Forgot/reset password routes have been added in Next as the first B1 implementation slice:
  - `/forgot-password`
  - `/reset-password`
  - `/login` links to forgot password
  - `proxy.ts` treats forgot/reset routes as public so Supabase recovery links can load
- Username login is implemented through `lookup_app_login_email(identifier)` over active `app_users`; the login page accepts either email or username and then signs in with Supabase Auth email/password.
- Additive target auth/permission schema migration has been drafted as `20260518093001_create_app_auth_permission_tables.sql`.
- Server auth context helper exists at `apps/next/src/lib/server/auth-context.ts`.
- `/api/auth/me` exists as a protected route to return current auth/app user, roles, and permission codes.
- `/api/admin/users` exists as the first user-management API slice and requires `system.users.manage`.
- `/api/admin/users` also supports creating `app_users` with role and branch assignments; it does not create or store passwords.
- `/api/admin/users/[id]` supports editing app user profile, role assignments, branch access, active status, and must-change-password flag.
- `/api/admin/users/[id]/invite` supports admin-triggered invite/reset email:
  - users without `auth_user_id`: sends Supabase Auth invite with service-role key on trusted server
  - users with `auth_user_id`: sends Supabase reset-password email
  - email redirect correctness depends on Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration and Email Templates:
    - `Site URL`: `https://new-ns-scrap-erp.vercel.app`
    - Redirect URLs: include `https://new-ns-scrap-erp.vercel.app/**` and local dev URLs such as `http://localhost:3000/**`
    - Invite/reset templates should use `{{ .RedirectTo }}` when the code supplies `redirectTo`; otherwise Supabase may fall back to the wrong `{{ .SiteURL }}`
- `/admin/users-permissions` exists as a Next page over real `app_users`, `app_roles`, and active branches, with create/edit modal flow.
- User active/inactive can be changed from `/admin/users-permissions` through `/api/admin/users/[id]/status`; self-deactivation is blocked.
- Admin Supabase Auth user has been linked into `app_users` through `scripts/seed-app-admin.mjs`; the script reads `APP_ADMIN_EMAIL` or `DEV_LOGIN_IDENTIFIER` and does not store passwords.
- App auth SQL helper functions exist in `dev-target`: `current_app_user_id`, `current_app_role_codes`, `current_app_permission_codes`, `is_app_admin`, and `has_app_permission`.
- Next `proxy.ts` now checks normalized app permissions by path, allows active app users on non-mapped paths, and falls back to legacy `user_profiles` admin/owner guard during transition.
- Sidebar navigation now fetches `/api/auth/me` and hides menu items that require permissions the current user does not have.
- `lookup_app_login_email(identifier)` exists for pre-auth username/email lookup and is granted to `anon`/`authenticated`; it returns email only for active `app_users`.
- B5 hardening has started:
  - Audit / Activity logging has been redesigned after B5: `app_audit_logs` is the append-only source for trace-critical security/write/permission events, while `app_activity_logs` is the append-only source for page/session/action activity.
  - `app_auth_events` remains in `dev-target` as compatibility/history storage only; new user create/edit/status/invite/reset actions write to `app_audit_logs` and still backfill the old table during transition.
  - `/api/activity` records authenticated best-effort page/action activity, and `/api/admin/auth-events` remains the compatibility list endpoint that now reads a unified feed from `app_audit_logs` + `app_activity_logs`.
  - `/admin/audit` exposes audit/activity events to users with `system.audit.view`; the page supports group/search/actor/target/event-type filters, server pagination, current-page CSV export, and row detail metadata; `/admin/user-activity` is intentionally folded into `/admin/audit` in the Next navigation.
  - Implemented admin/master-data error case baseline: API responses normalize auth, validation, conflict, not-found, database, and server failures; client pages normalize network, permission, conflict, and invalid-response messages before showing them in Thai.
  - `app_set_updated_at()` has fixed `search_path = public`
- Master-data route-level API guards now enforce normalized permissions directly for customer, supplier, and product view/create/status/export actions, in addition to proxy path checks.
- Branch-scope enforcement is the next auth/permission hardening item. The target behavior is:
  - `app_user_branch_access` is the source for scoped branch access; admin/owner roles can be treated as all-branch users.
  - UI selectors may improve UX, but data security must be enforced in server APIs and queries.
  - `/api/branches` should return only active branches visible to the current user. The topbar value `all` means all visible/allowed branches, not all branches globally.
  - Any API with branch-bound data must intersect requested branch filters with the current user's allowed branch ids.
  - Detail endpoints should return 404/403 for records outside the user's branch scope.
  - First implementation batch should cover purchase APIs that are already actively used in UI filters: bills, payments, payment history, and PO buy.
- RLS/permission model is not final; current app gating now uses normalized permissions for mapped paths, but table-level RLS rollout still needs table-by-table UAT.
- Supabase advisors still report many legacy/base tables with policies but RLS disabled; those are not changed in this auth batch because enabling them globally could break legacy-compatible flows and needs a table-by-table UAT plan.

## Legacy Findings

### Legacy DB Tables / Functions

Legacy source has these auth-adjacent structures:

| Source | Current Use / Risk | Target Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `auth.users` | Supabase-managed auth table | Keep as login source of truth |
| `public.users` | App user table with `password`, `role_id`, `branch_id`, `must_change_pwd`, `active` | Replace with `app_users`; do not keep password |
| `public.user_profiles` | Profile linked to `auth.users`, has `username`, `display_name`, `email`, `role`, `branch_ids`, `active` | Merge/refactor into `app_users` and branch access tables |
| `public.roles_config` | `role`, `permissions jsonb`, `description` | Normalize to `app_roles` + `app_permissions` + `app_role_permissions` |
| `public.roles` | Legacy role table exists in dump | Audit before deciding whether to migrate rows |
| `public.lookup_user_email(username)` | Finds active profile email by username | Replace with safe username-to-email lookup if username login is required |
| `public.current_user_role()` | Reads role from `user_profiles` | Replace with app role helper/RLS strategy |
| `public.current_user_branches()` | Reads branch ids from `user_profiles` | Replace with `user_branch_access` |
| `public.has_branch_access(branch_id)` | Branch access helper | Rebuild after branch access schema |
| `public.is_admin()` | Treats `Admin`/`Owner` as admin | Rebuild using normalized roles/permissions |

Important risks:
- `public.users.password` exists in the legacy model and must not be used in the target app.
- Existing `roles_config.permissions` is JSONB and should be used as migration/reference input, not as final permission storage.
- `user_profiles_user_id_fkey` was not cleanly restored into `dev-target` because legacy auth users were not migrated. This is acceptable until auth migration is designed.

Legacy row counts from the audit snapshot:
- `public.users`: 29
- `public.user_profiles`: 17
- `public.roles`: 14
- `public.roles_config`: 7

Current Prisma introspection already contains:
- `auth_users` mapped to `auth.users`
- `public_users` mapped to `public.users`
- `user_profiles`
- `roles`
- `roles_config`

These models are available for read/audit, but target implementation should add new normalized tables rather than expanding legacy password-bearing structures.

### Legacy UI Role Baseline

The Vue clone page `old-apps/vue/src/views/admin/UsersPermissionsView.vue` currently models:

Users fixture:
- `admin`
- `owner`
- `accountant`
- `cashier`
- `purchaser`
- `sales`
- `warehouse`

Roles fixture:
- `R-ADMIN` / Admin: all menus, all branch scope, sees cost/profit/cash/financials/opening
- `R-OWNER` / Owner: all menus, all branch scope, sees cost/profit/cash/financials/opening
- `R-ACCOUNTANT` / บัญชี: finance/accounting/reporting plus purchase/sales/master basics
- `R-ACCOUNT-EXPENSE` / บัญชีค่าใช้จ่าย: accountant plus expense/petty advance
- `R-COORDINATOR` / ประสานงาน: purchase/sales/stock/trading/PO coordination, sees cost but not profit/cash/financials
- `R-POOPAE` / Poopae: special broad role including production, assets, loans, import master
- `R-WAREHOUSE` / คลัง: branch-scoped stock/production role, does not see cost/profit/cash/financials

Permission dimensions already implied by legacy UI:
- menu visibility
- branch scope: `all` or `own`
- see cost
- see profit
- see cash/bank
- see financial statements
- edit opening balance

## Target Principles

- Use `auth.users` as authentication source of truth.
- Do not store passwords in application tables.
- Use Supabase password reset / recovery flow.
- Keep app-specific user profile data in `app_users`.
- Normalize permissions instead of relying on duplicated JSON permission blobs.
- Use `app_*` table names for new target auth/permission tables so they do not collide with legacy `public.roles` or `public.users`.
- Enforce permissions in both UI and API. Hiding buttons is not enough.
- Use RLS only after the application permission model is verified in `dev-target`.
- Keep legacy `public.users`, `user_profiles`, and `roles_config` as reference until migration mapping is signed off.

## Proposed Target Schema

Initial tables:
- `app_users`
  - `id`
  - `auth_user_id`
  - `username`
  - `display_name`
  - `email`
  - `active`
  - `must_change_password`
  - `last_login_at`
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`
- `app_roles`
  - `id`
  - `code`
  - `name`
  - `description`
  - `is_system`
  - `branch_scope`
  - `active`
- `app_permissions`
  - `id`
  - `code`
  - `module`
  - `resource`
  - `action`
  - `description`
- `app_role_permissions`
  - `role_id`
  - `permission_id`
- `app_user_roles`
  - `user_id`
  - `role_id`
- `app_user_branch_access`
  - `user_id`
  - `branch_id`
- Optional later:
  - `auth_events`
  - `permission_audit_logs`

Permission code shape:
- `master.customers.view`
- `master.customers.create`
- `master.customers.update`
- `master.customers.export`
- `master.customers.status`
- `finance.cash.view`
- `finance.financials.view`
- `stock.ledger.view`
- `system.users.manage`
- `system.roles.manage`

## Batch Plan

### Batch B0: Legacy Auth/Permission Audit

Goal:
- Confirm how old login/users/roles/permissions worked and what must be preserved.

Tasks:
- Audit `public.users`, `user_profiles`, `roles`, `roles_config` columns and row counts in `dev-target`.
- Extract legacy role names, role ids, and permission JSON shape from `roles_config`.
- Compare DB roles with Vue clone fixture roles.
- Map legacy menu keys to Next route paths.
- Decide whether username login is required in addition to email login.

Validation:
- Read-only DB queries only.
- Document row counts and mapping gaps.

### Batch B1: Auth UX Baseline

Goal:
- Make login/logout/reset password production-shaped before full user management.

Tasks:
- Add forgot-password page.
- Add reset/update password page.
- Add auth callback/recovery handling route if required by Supabase flow.
- Add Thai error copy for common Supabase Auth failures.
- Add username lookup only if B0 confirms requirement and safe lookup is available.
- Keep dev login prefill dev-only.

Validation:
- Login success/failure smoke.
- Logout smoke.
- Forgot password request smoke.
- Reset-password route smoke with simulated/real recovery link in dev-target.

### Batch B2: Target Auth Schema

Goal:
- Add non-destructive target tables for app users and permissions.

Tasks:
- Create additive migration for `app_users`, `app_roles`, `app_permissions`, `app_role_permissions`, `app_user_roles`, `app_user_branch_access`.
- Seed baseline system roles from audited legacy roles.
- Seed permission catalog from route/menu model.
- Link current admin Supabase Auth user to `app_users`.
- Do not drop legacy `public.users`, `user_profiles`, or `roles_config`.

Validation:
- `supabase db push --dry-run`.
- `supabase db push` to `dev-target`.
- Row count checks.
- FK/orphan checks.
- RLS remains conservative until enforcement design is validated.

### Batch B3: User Management UI/API

Goal:
- Build admin user management without storing passwords.

Tasks:
- Next routes under `/admin/users-permissions` or equivalent.
- User list, create/invite, edit profile, active toggle.
- Assign roles.
- Assign branch access.
- Resend password reset/invite.
- No hardcoded password fields.

Validation:
- Admin-only route/API smoke.
- Create/update/deactivate user smoke in dev-target.
- Zod validation for every field.

### Batch B4: Permission Enforcement

Goal:
- Replace admin-only gate with normalized role/permission checks.

Tasks:
- Server helper for current app user.
- Server helper for `hasPermission(code)`.
- Route/menu visibility from permissions.
- API guards for view/create/update/export/status.
- Action button guards.
- Branch-scope filtering where applicable.

Validation:
- Admin user can access all intended routes.
- Non-admin role sees only allowed menus.
- Forbidden API returns 403 even when called directly.
- Branch-scoped user cannot access other branch data where branch scope applies.

### Batch B5: RLS and Hardening

Goal:
- Move from app-only enforcement to DB-backed security where practical.

Tasks:
- Design RLS helper functions based on normalized tables.
- Enable/adjust RLS policies table group by table group.
- Add audit log for security-sensitive changes.
- Consider rate limiting for login/reset endpoints later if needed.

Validation:
- Supabase advisors reviewed.
- RLS smoke using admin/non-admin users.
- Regression smoke for master data API.

## Open Decisions

- Username login is supported through `app_users.username -> app_users.email -> Supabase Auth`; do not use legacy `public.users.password`.
- Should `Owner` be equivalent to `Admin`, or a separate role with broad business visibility but limited system settings?
- Should system roles be editable, clone-only, or fully locked?
- Should role permissions be menu-only first, then action-level later, or action-level from the start?
- Which routes require branch-scope filtering in Phase 1?
- Phase 1 branch-scope priority is Purchase first (`/api/purchase/bills`, `/api/purchase/payments`, `/api/purchase/payment-history`, `/api/purchase/po-buy`), then Sales/Stock/Daily/Finance APIs with branch-bound records.
- Should reset password be invite-only for new users, or should admins also set temporary passwords? Current recommendation: no admin-set password; use invite/reset email.

## Approved Batch: Fail-Closed Branch Scope Resolver (2026-07-18)

### Scope

This batch corrects only the shared application branch-scope resolution. It does not change the role matrix, direct permission overrides, database schema, RLS, navigation mapping, or action-level permissions.

### Decision

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Source of truth | `app_roles.branch_scope` and `app_user_branch_access` remain the source of truth for runtime branch scope. |
| All-branch access | A user is unrestricted only when at least one active assigned role has `branch_scope = 'all'` (or the retained legacy admin/owner compatibility flag is true). |
| Scoped access | `own` and `custom` both resolve to the normalized, unique branch codes assigned through `app_user_branch_access` until their business meanings are intentionally separated. |
| Missing mapping | A non-all-branch user with no assigned branch resolves to `[]`, never `null`; reads return no branch-bound rows and branch-bound writes are rejected by their existing scope guards. |
| Requested branch | A requested branch is normalized to uppercase and returned only when it is in the effective scope; otherwise the result is `[]`. |
| Shared policy | General APIs and finance APIs must call one pure resolver so they cannot disagree on unrestricted, scoped, or empty access. |
| Compatibility | No data fallback, arbitrary requested-branch grant, or silent unrestricted behavior is permitted. Bad/missing access data must be repaired at its source. |

### Design

Create one pure resolver in the server auth module that accepts the minimal branch-relevant context and an optional requested code. It returns `null` only for confirmed all-branch access, otherwise a normalized array that may be empty. `getBranchCodeIntersection()` remains the public general API wrapper; the finance helper delegates to the same resolver rather than carrying duplicated logic. Existing query conventions already distinguish `null` (unrestricted) from `[]` (empty `IN []`), so no route contract or schema migration is needed in this batch.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. A `custom` or `own` user without branch assignments resolves to `[]` for both unfiltered and explicit branch requests.
2. A role with `branch_scope = 'all'` resolves to `null` unfiltered and to its normalized explicit requested code when supplied.
3. Scoped users receive only their assigned normalized branch codes; unassigned requested codes resolve to `[]`.
4. General and finance wrappers return identical values for equivalent contexts.
5. Focused Vitest coverage prevents a regression to arbitrary requested-branch access or empty-scope unrestricted access.

### Out of Scope / Next Batches

- Decide whether direct per-user `deny` overrides may restrict system administrators, then make proxy and server enforcement identical.
- Replace module-wide path permissions with explicit `view/create/update/cancel/approve/export` guards per API action.
- Decide whether role assignment remains one access profile per employee or supports multiple active profiles; separate job title from access role.
- Apply RLS table by table only after the application-level policy and data mappings are verified in `dev-target`.
