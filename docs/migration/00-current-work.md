## Next Required Batch

`Batch PRE: System Map and API Contract Baseline`

Tasks:

1. Create `docs/migration/18-next-system-sitemap.md` - done locally
2. Inventory navigation routes vs real pages/APIs - done locally
3. Create `docs/api/openapi.yaml` skeleton - done locally
4. Add current API catalog baseline - done locally
5. Validate, commit, and push before `Batch S: Stock`

## Tailwind v4 Migration Status

Status: completed and pushed in the TW4 checkpoint.

Changes:

- `apps/next` now uses `tailwindcss@4.3.0` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.3.0`.
- `apps/next/postcss.config.cjs` now uses the Tailwind v4 PostCSS plugin.
- `apps/next/src/app/globals.css` now uses `@import "tailwindcss";` and CSS-first `@theme` tokens.
- Removed `apps/next/tailwind.config.ts`; active app theme tokens now live in CSS.
- Root `package.json` still keeps Tailwind v3 for old Vue tooling; this is intentional until old Vue tooling is removed or upgraded.

Validation passed:

- `npm ls tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`

## Playwright MCP Status

Status: configured and pushed.

Changes:

- Added `playwright` server to project-level `.mcp.json`.
- Command: `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --headless`
- Documented the setup in `docs/migration/10-environment-status.md`.

Validation passed:

- `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.mcp.json','utf8')); console.log('mcp json ok')"`
- `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --help`

Runtime note:

- Restart Codex before expecting `/mcp` or MCP resources/tools to show the new `playwright` server.

## Agent Rules Refactor Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `55c81c7`.

Changes:

- `AGENTS.md` is now a short entrypoint with hard rules, required reading, rule links, environment shortlist, and validation baseline.
- Detailed rules moved to `docs/agent-rules/`.
- `docs/migration/00-doc-index.md` now lists the agent rule documents.

Validation passed in its own checkpoint.

## System Map and API Contract Baseline Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `5ad3ab2`.

Changes:

- Added `docs/migration/18-next-system-sitemap.md`.
- Added `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Updated `docs/migration/17-next-remaining-modules-progress.md` with PRE0/PRE1 execution logs.

Current findings:

- `/stock/balance` is still a placeholder and is the first concrete page target for `Batch S`.
- `/stock/ledger` has a read baseline but still needs query/pagination/running-balance polish.
- Most main dashboard/reporting and finance-accounting routes remain placeholder coverage.

Validation:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npx --yes @redocly/cli lint docs/api/openapi.yaml` passed validity check with skeleton-level warnings for missing `operationId`, tag descriptions, and some 4XX responses.

## Current Priority Queue

1. Batch PRE: System Map and API Contract Baseline
2. Batch S: Stock
3. Batch F: Finance and Debt
4. Batch T: Tracking 360
5. Batch D: Dual Costing / Trading / PO
6. Batch FF: Foreign Finance
7. Batch A: Finance / Accounting
8. Batch M: Main Dashboards and Operational Control
9. Batch SYS: System and Cleanup

## Operating Model

Before each module batch:

1. Read the module overview and legacy source touchpoints.
2. Break the module into page-level tasks.
3. For each page, document the expected fields, buttons, modals, APIs, DB tables, validation, pagination/sort/export, and Playwright checks.
4. Implement in reviewable slices.
5. Update the relevant tracker before moving to the next slice.
6. Commit/push after each meaningful checkpoint.

Use sub agents only for bounded parallel work:

- legacy flow search
- route/API inventory
- independent page audit
- Playwright smoke verification
- isolated docs or page/API implementation with clear file ownership

For Playwright work, use a sub agent by default so browser QA can run in parallel while the main agent continues implementation or integration. The main agent must define the exact Playwright scope and then integrate findings before committing.

Close sub agents when their task is integrated, no longer needed, blocked, overlapping, or after a batch checkpoint leaves them with no remaining work. Do not leave reminder agents open unless the user explicitly requested one for the active task list.

## Handoff Checklist

At every checkpoint, update docs as if a new session will start from only the repository:

1. Current batch/task/page
2. Exact partial work and files touched
3. Commands already run and result
4. Validation still required
5. Next concrete task
6. Whether to continue immediately or pause for discussion

## Known Carry-over Work

- `reports/` is untracked/local and must not be committed unless explicitly approved.
- Production write flow is not complete:
  - create/edit production order
  - production input/output write
  - process cost write
  - reverse/cancel/close/lock cost
  - stock ledger/cost allocation reconciliation
- Purchase follow-ups:
  - void/reversal
  - PO remaining qty reconciliation
  - header/line table refactor
- Sales follow-ups:
  - create/edit/post
  - FIFO/COGS
- Stock follow-ups:
  - Stock module pages still need Batch S
  - Stock transfer cancel/void and cost source still pending
- Finance follow-ups:
  - Payment approval persistence/printing
  - AP/AR allocation/reconciliation
- Auth/permission:
  - branch-scope enforcement
  - full legacy role matrix migration
