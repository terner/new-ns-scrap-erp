# 00 Current Work

## Current Status

Date: 2026-05-19
Active app: `apps/next`
Primary remote: `new-origin`
Last pushed checkpoint: FF4 FCD Ledger baseline (`7088964 feat: add fcd ledger read baseline`)

## Current Batch

`Batch FF: Foreign Finance`

Goal:

- Port foreign finance routes from placeholders into Next page/API baselines.
- Start with FX/FCD/read reports before money-moving transfers or receipts.
- Keep bank statement mutation, FX gain/loss posting, import/match writes, and reversal flows disabled until idempotency and reconciliation rules are clear.
- During this and future clone batches, keep the legacy/Vue screen as the visual baseline first. Preserve cards, colors, banners, tables, button placement, labels, and spacing unless a documented deviation is approved.

## Next Required Batch

`Batch F: Finance and Debt`

Tasks:

1. F0 legacy inventory and DB mapping - docs checkpoint first
2. F1 AR page/API - next implementation slice
3. F2 AP polish - existing AP route/page needs filter/sort/pagination/export/detail review
4. F3 Bank Statement - next read/reconciliation baseline after AR/AP
5. F4-F6 Cash Position, Supplier Advance, Customer Advance - read baseline first, no allocation/write rule guesses

## Tailwind v4 Migration Status

Status: completed and pushed in the TW4 checkpoint.

Changes:

- `apps/next` now uses `tailwindcss@4.3.0` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.3.0`.
- `apps/next/postcss.config.cjs` now uses the Tailwind v4 PostCSS plugin.
- `apps/next/src/app/globals.css` now uses `@import "tailwindcss";` and CSS-first `@theme` tokens.
- Removed `apps/next/tailwind.config.ts`; active app theme tokens now live in CSS.
- Root `package.json` still keeps Tailwind v3 for old Vue tooling; this is intentional until old Vue tooling is removed or upgraded.

Validation passed:

- `npm ls tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`

## Playwright MCP Status

Status: configured and pushed.

Changes:

- Added `playwright` server to project-level `.mcp.json`.
- Command: `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --headless`
- Documented the setup in `docs/migration/10-environment-status.md`.

Validation passed:

- `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.mcp.json','utf8')); console.log('mcp json ok')"`
- `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --help`

Runtime note:

- Restart Codex before expecting `/mcp` or MCP resources/tools to show the new `playwright` server.

## Agent Rules Refactor Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `55c81c7`.

Changes:

- `AGENTS.md` is now a short entrypoint with hard rules, required reading, rule links, environment shortlist, and validation baseline.
- Detailed rules moved to `docs/agent-rules/`.
- `docs/migration/00-doc-index.md` now lists the agent rule documents.

Validation passed in its own checkpoint.

## System Map and API Contract Baseline Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `5ad3ab2`.

Changes:

- Added `docs/migration/18-next-system-sitemap.md`.
- Added `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Updated `docs/migration/17-next-remaining-modules-progress.md` with PRE0/PRE1 execution logs.

Current findings:

- `/stock/balance` is still a placeholder and is the first concrete page target for `Batch S`.
- `/stock/ledger` has a read baseline but still needs query/pagination/running-balance polish.
- Most main dashboard/reporting and finance-accounting routes remain placeholder coverage.

Validation:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npx --yes @redocly/cli lint docs/api/openapi.yaml` passed validity check with skeleton-level warnings for missing `operationId`, tag descriptions, and some 4XX responses.

## Current Priority Queue

1. Batch F: Finance and Debt
2. Batch T: Tracking 360
3. Batch D: Dual Costing / Trading / PO
4. Batch FF: Foreign Finance
5. Batch A: Finance / Accounting
6. Batch M: Main Dashboards and Operational Control
7. Batch SYS: System and Cleanup

## Batch S Stock Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `42ce82b`.

Implemented in this checkpoint:

- Added stock balance, status convert, grade convert, stock count adjust, and customer return API/page baselines.
- Hardened stock OpenAPI contract for touched stock endpoints with operation IDs, real query parameters, request schemas, and stock response schemas.
- Adjusted stock write forms to support direct `?new=1` URLs for form smoke testing and resumable links.
- Ran authenticated browser/API smoke with the provided dev user; credentials were used only in the browser session and were not stored in docs or code.

Verification already run:

- Desktop browser smoke: all six stock pages returned HTTP 200 with no login/error state.
- Mobile browser smoke at 390x844: stock read pages and write forms rendered without visible errors.
- Authenticated API smoke: all six stock APIs returned HTTP 200.
- Write form smoke: `/stock/status-convert?new=1`, `/stock/convert?new=1`, `/stock/adjust?new=1`, and `/stock/customer-return?new=1` rendered title, fields, cancel, and save controls; no submit was performed.
- `npx --yes @redocly/cli lint docs/api/openapi.yaml --max-problems 200` passed validity with existing skeleton warnings outside the stock batch.

Final local validation:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.

Commit:

- `42ce82b feat: add stock module baselines` pushed to `main`.

Known carry-over from Batch S:

- Stock ledger row detail modal remains a follow-up.
- Field-level validation messages on stock write forms remain a follow-up; server-side Zod validation is active.
- Reconciliation query/report for grade convert and count adjust remains a follow-up.
- Void/reversal and final WAC/cost-source policy remain broader stock hardening work.

## Batch F Finance and Debt Status

- F1 AR read/report baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F2 AP polish is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F3 Bank Statement read/reconciliation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F4 Cash Position aggregation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F5 Supplier Advance read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F6 Customer Advance read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F7 Finance QA checkpoint is documented and pushed.

## Batch T Tracking 360 Status

Status: active batch started after finance checkpoint `1c0b5c7`.

Current scope:

- T0 inventory and DB mapping is documented and pushed.
- T1 Customer Tracking read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T2 Supplier Tracking polish is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T3 Product Tracking read/report baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T4 Tracking QA Batch passed after correcting Product Tracking slow movers, and is pushed.
- D0 Dual Costing / Trading / PO legacy inventory and DB mapping is complete and pushed.
- D1 PO Sell read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- D2 PO Buy read-only polish is implemented, validated, and pushed. Write flows remain deferred.
- D3 Trading Dashboard read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. Dashboard remains read-only.
- D4 Trading Matching read-only polish is implemented, validated, and pushed. Write/reverse/recalc actions remain deferred.
- D5 Cost Pool read-derived baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. UI keeps the legacy amber warning band, blue/orange/purple cost cards, summary cards, filters, export, table, and read-only detail modal; write allocation remains deferred.
- D6 Cost Allocator read-only simulation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. UI keeps the legacy purple step-card flow; confirm/write remains disabled until allocation logs and reversal rules are designed.
- D7a Match Log read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reads `trading_deals` as current source because normalized allocation logs are not designed yet; reverse/write remains deferred.
- D7b Deal Margin read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reads `trading_deals` matched sales/purchase amounts and preserves the legacy purple/pink gross margin card layout.
- D7c Compare Margin read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It compares deal-side `trading_deals` with stock-side `sales_bills` revenue/COGS and preserves the legacy blue/purple/emerald diff-card layout.
- D8 Dual Costing QA checkpoint is implemented, validated, and pushed. It fixed PO Sell date filters, Trading Matching filter scope, Cost Pool business-facing display refs/status options, Cost Allocator modes, Deal Margin match status, Compare Margin stock scope, and PO Sell OpenAPI row names.
- FF0 Foreign Finance legacy inventory and DB mapping is completed and pushed. FF1 FX Rate manage baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- Tracking routes must use active Next app only; legacy/Vue tracking views are source material.
- Keep T1-T3 read/report baselines first; no write flows in tracking pages.
- DB design preference clarified: use meaningful business-facing codes/running document numbers for user-visible references; keep UUID/opaque IDs internal only.
- Permission carry-over: trading/dual-costing currently uses `finance.cash.view`; split into dedicated trading/cost/profit permissions in a later auth batch instead of changing guards ad hoc.

Initial F0 findings:

- Legacy/Vue finance-debt pages: AR, AP, Bank Statement, Cash Position, Supplier Advance, Customer Advance.
- Related money write flows already exist in daily/purchase/sales surfaces: supplier payments, customer receipts, petty advances/returns, transfers, payment approval, and transaction ledger.
- Target DB mapping: `sales_bills`, `receipts`, `purchase_bills`, `payments`, `bank_statement`, `accounts`, plus party and branch lookup tables.
- Bank statement rows are shared side effects from payment/receipt/expense/transfer/petty flows, so bank reconciliation should be read-first before any write changes.

Initial FF0 findings:

- Active Next foreign finance routes started as placeholders: International Transfer, Overseas Receipt, FX Rate, FCD Ledger, FX Gain/Loss, and Bank Reconciliation. FF1 promotes FX Rate to a manage baseline.
- Existing support tables are `accounts`, `bank_statement`, `currencies`, `fx_gain_loss`, `overseas_recipients`, and `overseas_remittance_purposes`.
- FF1 adds historical `fx_rates`. There is still no dedicated `fcd_ledger` table, no confirmed `intl_transfers`/`overseas_receipts` tables, and no `bank_imports` table in the active Prisma schema.
- FF4 FCD Ledger read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It derives from FCD/foreign-currency accounts and bank statement rows without mutating bank rows.
- FCD Ledger does not infer foreign movement from THB bank rows or current currency rates. Foreign movement stays zero unless future ITF/ORC source tables provide true foreign amounts; opening foreign balance comes from `accounts.opening_balance`.
- FF5 FX Gain/Loss read baseline is implemented locally, validated, and ready for commit/push. It reads realized rows from `fx_gain_loss` only and does not auto-post.
- User-facing refs should be `ITF*`, `ORC*`, `ref_no`, account code/account no, and currency symbol/code; do not expose UUID/ref_id as the primary display.

Next concrete task:

1. Commit and push FF5 FX Gain/Loss read baseline.
2. Start FF2/FF3 read/form baseline or FF6 bank reconciliation design baseline, while keeping money-moving writes deferred.
3. Use sub agents by default for Playwright/browser QA, and split read-only scouting/contract review into parallel sub agents when work can be separated cleanly.

## Operating Model

Before each module batch:

1. Read the module overview and legacy source touchpoints.
2. Break the module into page-level tasks.
3. For each page, document the expected fields, buttons, modals, APIs, DB tables, validation, pagination/sort/export, and Playwright checks.
4. Implement in reviewable slices.
5. Update the relevant tracker before moving to the next slice.
6. Commit/push after each meaningful checkpoint.

Use sub agents only for bounded parallel work:

- legacy flow search
- route/API inventory
- independent page audit
- Playwright smoke verification
- isolated docs or page/API implementation with clear file ownership

For Playwright work, use a sub agent by default so browser QA can run in parallel while the main agent continues implementation or integration. The main agent must define the exact Playwright scope and then integrate findings before committing.

Close sub agents when their task is integrated, no longer needed, blocked, overlapping, or after a batch checkpoint leaves them with no remaining work. Do not leave reminder agents open unless the user explicitly requested one for the active task list.

## Handoff Checklist

At every checkpoint, update docs as if a new session will start from only the repository:

1. Current batch/task/page
2. Exact partial work and files touched
3. Commands already run and result
4. Validation still required
5. Next concrete task
6. Whether to continue immediately or pause for discussion
