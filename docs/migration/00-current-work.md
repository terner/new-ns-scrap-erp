## Current Batch

`Batch SYS: System and Cleanup`

Goal:

- Finish remaining system/admin/report placeholders and then run a full navigation QA pass.
- Implement self-service password change through Supabase Auth only; never store or migrate password values into application tables.
- Keep migration/backup/reset tools as safe read/design baselines until destructive actions have explicit confirmation, audit, backup, RLS, and rollback design.
- Build `/reports` as an index/search surface over active report routes before duplicating report-specific query logic.
- During this and future clone batches, keep the legacy/Vue screen as the visual baseline first. Preserve cards, colors, banners, tables, button placement, labels, spacing, and compact density unless a documented deviation is approved. If Vue has been simplified or has known layout/column drift, use `old-apps/legacy/` as the stronger baseline before improving the data wiring.
- Current docs slice: SYS0 System/Admin module overview is implemented, validated, and pushed. It maps `/admin/change-password`, `/admin/migration-tools`, `/reports`, admin polish, full-route QA order, permissions, and destructive-action safety constraints.
- Current implementation slice: SYS1 `/admin/change-password` self-service Supabase Auth flow is implemented, validated, and pushed. It preserves legacy UI, validates password syntax/confirmation/current-password, verifies current password with Supabase Auth, updates via `updateUser`, and does not store password in app tables.
- Current implementation slice: SYS2 `/admin/migration-tools` safe read/design baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It preserves legacy Backup/Restore cards while disabling export, restore, cloud migration, user migration, reset, snapshot cleanup, and auto-backup actions until destructive-action design is approved.
- Current polish slice: SYS3 `/admin/audit` and `/admin/users-permissions` polish is implemented, validated, and pushed. Audit now has current-page CSV export; Users & Permissions now has summary cards for active, branch-scoped, pending Auth link, and must-change-password users. Branch-scope enforcement remains a SYS5/auth hardening follow-up.
- Current QA slice: SYS5 full system cleanup route QA is implemented, validated, and pushed. It confirmed all active navigation routes have dedicated pages, protected routes redirect unauthenticated users, SYS routes render authenticated desktop/mobile without page-level overflow, and the retrospective legacy UI parity backlog is now queued.
- Current sales cleanup slice: `/sales/po-sell` moves its explanatory PO Sell copy to the app topbar, removes the in-page info banner and Top 5/outstanding panels, enables the `+ PO Sell ใหม่` form/API create path, and aligns the create modal with the compact PO Buy modal. `/sales/bills` moves its explanatory copy to the app topbar, removes the in-page sales hero and Pending Sale warning strip, enables the `+ บิลขายใหม่` form/API create path, uses one `สาขา/คลัง` dropdown from branch master in the modal, aligns item/VAT/summary/note sections with the purchase bill modal, and enables filtered Excel export. Validation passed locally: `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`, `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`, `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`, and `git diff --check`.
- Current master data cleanup slice: master data `สาขา/คลัง` wording is split. `/master-data/branches` now labels the entity as `สาขา`, and new `/master-data/warehouses` uses the existing `warehouses` table with branch linkage, generic master data UI, list/create/update/status API routes, and navigation entry under `ข้อมูลหลัก`.
- Current supplier payment numbering follow-up: `/api/purchase/payments` now derives `payments.branch_id` from the linked purchase bill first and the payment account second, then generates supplier payment document numbers as `PMT{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN` (for example `PMT012605-0271`). The running number scan includes both old `PMT2605-*` and new branch-aware `PMT012605-*` rows in the same month so numbering continues instead of restarting.
- Current supplier payment UI follow-up: `/purchase/payments` topbar now shows `จ่ายเงิน Supplier-บันทึกเงินออกจากบัญชีและประวัติ voucher จ่าย Supplier`, while the in-page payment banner is removed. The page shows a merged `บิล Supplier ทั้งหมด` table above Payment Voucher history using legacy headers: เลขบิล, วันที่, Supplier, เลขบัญชี, ยอดรวม, จ่ายแล้ว, คงเหลือ, อายุ(วัน), and action. The table includes unpaid, partial, paid, and cancelled purchase bills from `purchase_bills`, has status/search filters, client-side pagination with the standard `พบทั้งหมด ... รายการ` footer pattern, and a `ทำจ่าย` row action only while `payable_balance > 0`. The payment modal follows the legacy Payment Voucher flow while hiding system-managedเลขที่/วันที่/สาขา fields: method selector, split-capable `บัญชีจ่าย` section with account balances, multi-line `รายการจ่าย` table with `+ เพิ่มบรรทัด` and bill search datalist, and final note field. If opened from a bill row, the modal locks the first bill row as read-only instead of asking the user to select it again. Required fields are marked with `*`; payment lines, account split, method, supplier, and amount cannot submit empty/null. WHT is read-only in the modal and is computed from the active `wht_settings` rate; the API recomputes WHT before saving so users only enter the cash amount they want to pay. Payment account splits now write one `bank_statement` row per account while `payments.account_id` keeps the first account for compatibility; multiple payment lines share the same voucher/document number and create one `payments` row per bill line.

## Previous Batch M Notes

- Current docs slice: M0 Main Dashboards module overview is implemented, validated, and pushed. It maps all 11 remaining Main placeholder routes, their legacy/Vue visual baselines, shared data sources, write risks, and recommended implementation order.
- Current implementation slice: M1 `/dashboard`, `/owner-daily`, and `/daily-report` read/report baselines is implemented, validated, and pushed.

- Current implementation slice: M5 `/cash-others-summary` and `/anomaly-detector` read baselines is implemented and validated locally. It keeps Cash & Others legacy visual blocks and Anomaly Detector read-only scan behavior, with fix actions limited to active Next links.
- Current QA slice: M6 Main QA sweep is implemented, validated, and pushed. It confirmed 11/11 Main route/page/API coverage, unauth guards, authenticated API/page smoke, read-only/write-control constraints, sitemap status, and desktop/mobile no page-level overflow.

## Previous Batch A Notes

- Current implementation slice: A5 Financial Statements management/read baselines is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- Current implementation slice: A4 Tax / VAT / WHT transaction-derived read/design baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.

- Current implementation slice: A3 Working Capital + Stock Finance read baselines (`working-capital`, `stock-finance`, `profit-leak`) is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reuses AR/AP/stock/cash sources, preserves legacy UI first, and keeps financing/reclass/write actions disabled until accounting side effects are designed.
- Current implementation slice: A1 Financial Dashboard read baseline (`financial-dashboard`) is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reuses A2/A3/A5 helper outputs where practical, preserves legacy UI first, and keeps GL/statutory/write actions disabled.
- A6 Fixed Assets read baseline (`asset-register`, `depreciation`, `asset-disposal`) is implemented, validated, and pushed. Keep acquisition, depreciation posting/reverse, disposal status mutation, and GL posting disabled until accounting side effects are designed.
- A7 Loans / Equity / Opening / Historical read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. Keep loan schedule/payment generation, equity save, opening balance apply/lock, historical save/sync, and GL posting disabled until accounting side effects are designed.
- Current QA slice: A8 Accounting QA Batch is implemented, validated, and pushed. It confirmed 18/18 Finance / Accounting page/API coverage, unauth guards, authenticated route/API smoke, and disabled write controls.
- A5 must remain labeled as management/read baseline only. Do not claim statutory P&L/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow until GL journal header/line, COA mapping, closing period, retained earnings roll-forward, and cash-flow mapping are designed.

## Legacy UI Parity Retrospective

Status date: 2026-05-19

- Legacy/Vue UI parity became an explicit project rule at `59ba09f docs: require legacy ui parity for clone batches`.
- The rule was strengthened at `b2258d6 docs: strengthen legacy ui parity rule`, requiring clone/migration batches to preserve cards, colors, banners, tables, button placement, labels, spacing, and compact density; when Vue is simplified or inconsistent, `old-apps/legacy/` is the stronger baseline.
- Batches completed after `59ba09f` should be treated as implemented under the legacy UI parity rule. This includes the Foreign Finance baselines and the Finance / Accounting A6, A7, A5, and A4 batches already pushed.
- Batches completed before `59ba09f` were not guaranteed to have the same explicit visual parity standard. They should be queued for a retrospective UI parity audit/revise pass before being marked final for UAT, especially screens cloned from legacy/Vue with cards, dashboards, dense tables, or color-coded finance states.
- For future batches, do not redesign first. Clone the legacy visual surface first, wire active Next data second, then document any approved deviation.
- Current parity slice: `/finance/ap` was revised first after SYS. It restores the legacy AP red header, mega payable/aging/top supplier cards, colored KPIs, aging cards, red tabs, summary/detail table layout, Channel/Aging filters, and full-filter detail footer total while keeping export as active `.xlsx` behavior.
- Current parity slice: `/finance/ar` was revised after AP. It restores the legacy AR pending-sale banner, blue/cyan/teal dashboard cards, aging bars, Top 5 customer card, Channel/Aging filters, and detail table layout/colors while keeping export as active `.xlsx` behavior.
- Current parity slice: `/finance/cash-position` was revised after AR. It restores the legacy Cash Position dashboard cards, liquid composition donut, AR/AP bars, Top accounts list, colored summary cards, Net Cash strip, and account table columns/type badges.
- Current parity slice: `/finance/bank` was revised after Cash Position. It restores the legacy Bank Statement hero, account/date controls, four KPI cards, two chart panels, opening-balance row, dark gradient statement table header, colored amount columns, and disabled duplicate-cleanup button while keeping export as active `.xlsx` behavior.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/balance` was revised after Bank Statement. It restores the legacy Stock Balance hero, KPI/status cards, matrix/detail toggle, group/status/branch/product filters, selected-product inline panel, donut/top-group charts, metal-group matrix table, and detail table mode while keeping export as active `.xlsx` behavior.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/ledger` was revised after Stock Balance. It restores the legacy dense toolbar-first layout, product/branch/movement/date filters, balance-mode segmented control, negative-stock badge, disabled cleanup actions, legacy 12-column ledger table, colored movement/counterparty/balance cells, and active `.xlsx` export. Read-only bill/timeline modals and write actions such as grade fix or branch move remain deferred until permission/audit/write design is approved.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/convert` was revised after Stock Ledger. It restores the legacy Grade Adjustment hero/CTA, seven KPI cards, Source Type and Cost Status filters, red/green source-target table grouping, disabled Confirm Cost/Reverse actions, and source/target/loss/cost-flow modal grouping while keeping the existing simplified POST semantics unchanged. Full cost allocation, manual lot selection, reverse, and pending-cost workflows remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/adjust` was revised after Stock Convert. It restores the legacy Stock Count Adjustment amber hero, note-only warning, five KPI cards, Quick Adjust toolbar with branch/type/date filters, disabled CSV placeholder, 13-column adjustment table, and usage guidance box while preserving the existing note-only stock ledger write semantics.
- Current parity slice: `/sales/po-sell` was revised after Stock Adjust. It restores the legacy PO Sell info banner, six KPI cards, Top 5 Customer and PO outstanding panels, match-status chips, compact filter bar, 12-column table, and disabled create/edit/cancel actions while preserving the read/export baseline and deferring PO Sell writes/reconciliation design.
- Current parity slice: `/trading/dashboard` was revised after PO Sell to close the first-10 post-SYS UI parity audit. It restores the legacy violet/fuchsia Trading Dashboard hero, date filter card, mega Trading Performance card, Trading AR/AP card, ten KPI cards, trend/matching/product panels, Trading Purchases/Sales tables, and Trading by Product table. The API remains read-only and now derives legacy dashboard totals from trading purchase/sales bills plus `trading_deals`; Trading Matching write actions remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/finance/supplier-advance` and `/finance/customer-advance` are being revised after the first-10 audit. They restore the legacy compact advance layout: amber/emerald info banner copy, two summary cards plus disabled blue create CTA, 11-column table with Rate and disabled cancel action, legacy empty-state wording, and active `.xlsx` export as a secondary Next capability. Create/cancel/allocation writes remain deferred until dedicated advance/allocation schema, audit, RLS, rollback, and reconciliation design are approved.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/status-convert` and `/stock/customer-return` was revised after finance advance and pushed as `8ea1bbc`. It restores the legacy purple/pink compact stock operation surfaces while keeping send-back/export/reverse/cost-policy/write hardening deferred.
- Current parity slice: Daily Reports / รายงานประจำวัน was revised after stock operations and pushed as `dc1c30b`. It restores read-only legacy visual/data surfaces only: owner daily due-today/gap/activity/pending panels, daily report date controls, group breakdown, cash movement by type/account, expense category bars, analytics/top tables, and print dialog trigger. No posting/write/mutation actions are enabled.
- Current parity slice: Tracking 360 was revised after Daily Reports and pushed as `d4bc621`. It restores the legacy colored hero surfaces, compact filter cards, summary/top panels, tabs, dense tracking tables, product/supplier/customer selectors where available, yearly comparison tables, and Product Tracking legacy revenue-first sort. This remains read/export only; customer/supplier/product drilldown and item JSON normalization are still deferred until the data contract is confirmed.
- Current parity slice: Batch D Group A was revised after Tracking 360 and pushed as `0c9df8e`. It restores the legacy PO Buy blue info banner, colored KPI cards, Top Supplier/outstanding panels, compact filter/status/purpose-tab layout, checkbox/action table shell, and Trading Matching fuchsia hero/action cluster, GP mega card, status donut, match-rate/monthly/top-pair panels, compact KPI row, two-tab layout, and unmatched split tables. All create/move/cancel/cleanup/pull/recalc/reverse/match actions remain disabled/read-only.
- Added to post-SYS parity queue per user request: `/admin/company-profile` (`https://new-ns-scrap-erp.vercel.app/admin/company-profile`). It already exists in the system sitemap and visual audit checklist, but now must be rechecked under the same legacy-first rule after the current Batch D parity slices finish.
- Current parity slice: Batch D Group B was revised after Group A and pushed as `488f7fa`. It restores the legacy Cost Pool warning copy/icons, compact filters, 12-column table, and Cost Allocator `①/②` step sequence, Auto Match button placement, Manual option shell, preview table, and disabled confirm-match surface. No allocation/match write behavior is enabled.
- Current parity slice: `/admin/company-profile` was revised after Batch D Group B per user request and pushed as `bebef00`. It restores the legacy company-profile action row, separate receipt/delivery preview buttons, usage note wording, field labels/placeholders, logo delete label, and compact form density while preserving existing API validation and `system.settings.manage` write guard.
- Current follow-up slice: `/admin/company-profile` form border/preview parity is being revised after user feedback. It makes form/input/logo borders explicit with legacy-like slate borders and changes the receipt/delivery preview buttons from no-sample alerts to printable sample document tabs generated from the current company profile. No DB/schema/API endpoint change is added.
- Current follow-up slice: global Next form-control border parity is being revised after code scan. The scan found plain `border` form controls across 39 active Next files, so `apps/next/src/app/globals.css` now defines the legacy baseline for text/date/number/search inputs, selects, and textareas: slate border, white default field background, blue focus ring, and slate read-only background only when no explicit `bg-*` class is present. Explicit `border-*`, `bg-*`, checkbox/radio/file controls, and semantic state fields remain locally controlled.
- Current follow-up slice: global Next font parity is being revised after user request. Legacy and old Vue load Google Font `Sarabun` weights 300/400/500/600/700 and apply it to body and form controls, so `apps/next/src/app/globals.css` now loads the same font and replaces the previous Arial/Helvetica baseline.
- Current audit slice: post-SYS legacy UI parity audit was expanded by user request to every active Next section except `ข้อมูลหลัก` and `ระบบ`. Remote legacy HTML was downloaded from `https://sirimasth.github.io/ns-scrap-erp/` for source comparison. New tracker `docs/migration/19-next-legacy-ui-parity-audit.md` records P0/P1/P2 routes and active execution order. P0 starts with Daily tools: `/daily/payment-approval`, `/daily/expense`, and `/daily/expense-dashboard`.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/payment-approval` was revised after the expanded post-SYS audit. It restores the legacy green Payment Approval hero, AP/expense tabs, dense filters, five KPI strip, amber selected-total action bar, AP/expense tables, checkbox selection, highlighted bank/account columns, and local-only pay amount state. Approval and print controls remain disabled until write/audit/print semantics are designed; no API/DB mutation was added.
- Current purchase follow-up slice: `/purchase/po-buy` now exposes `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `updatedBy` from `GET /api/purchase/po-buy`, shows the table column `อัพเดตล่าสุด` with fallback to create audit data for legacy rows, sorts by that column, and includes `UpdatedAt`/`UpdatedBy` in filtered Excel export.
- Current table/filter polish slice: table total summaries now show only `พบทั้งหมด ... รายการ` while page controls keep `หน้า x / y`; `/sales/bills` filter styling now matches purchase bills with type/status segments and backend status/type filters; `/sales/po-sell` filter actions now use `Export Excel` and separated status/match-status rows.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/expense-dashboard` was revised after Payment Approval. It restores the legacy rose/orange dashboard-only surface with 3/6/12 month selector, four KPI cards, anomaly/no-anomaly panels, category-by-month heatmap, footer totals, and anomaly rule note. It uses the existing expenses GET payload and legacy-compatible `amount + vat` dashboard math; no write/export/repair action or API endpoint change was added.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/expense` was revised after Expense Dashboard. It restores the first legacy list/read surface: blue Expense Voucher banner and CTA, monthly/pending/paid/trend cards, category/payee progress panels, dense date/payee/account/status filters, count/total strip, and a denser table with due date, ref doc, category, overdue state, Net Pay emphasis, VAT/WHT breakdown, and edit action. Destructive repair tools, delete, quick-pay, export, multi-line voucher writes, and dynamic category creation remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/production/orders` was revised after Daily P0. It restores the first legacy production operations surface: date/status/preset filters, card-grid order list with status colors, target-product focus, input/planned/output KPIs, yield bar, cost footer, and a read-only tabbed detail modal with status actions disabled, target product banner, lock/status banners, Header/Input/Output/Process Cost/Cost Allocation tabs, production variance panel, and allocation preview. Production input/output/reverse/recompute/status writes remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/production/dashboard` was revised after Production Orders. It restores the legacy purple/pink dashboard hero, range presets/custom dates, four colored KPI cards, daily and monthly chart panels, status panel, Top 10 products table with code/cost/avg cost, and Machine Utilization table. API additions are read-only aggregates only; no stock/cost/posting mutation was added.
- Current parity slice: `/production/production-cost-report` was revised after Production Dashboard and closes the P0 Production group. It restores the legacy date filter/export row, seven cost cards, gradient Total/Cost per Kg card, 13-column RM/Labor/Electricity/Machine/Fuel/Maintenance/Other Process table, legacy CSV columns, and cost allocation method field from the read helper. No cost recalculation, stock write, or posting behavior was added.
- Current parity slice: `/po-reports/outstanding` was revised after P0 Production. It restores the legacy purple hero, buy/sell tabs, active CSV export, colored KPI cards, partner/product filters, cost-deducted warning and read-only checkbox shell, received/sold columns, expected delivery columns, empty states, and footer totals. Cost-deducted remains disabled because it is a cost-pool write side effect requiring audit/permission design.
- Current parity slice: `/reports` was revised after PO outstanding. It restores the legacy tabbed aggregate report surface as the primary screen with date range, "เว้นว่างเพื่อดูทุกช่วงเวลา", active CSV export, five purchase/sales aggregate tabs, dense tables, totals footer, and a read-only `/api/reports/aggregate` endpoint over purchase/sales bills. The previous Next report catalog is retained only as a secondary shortcut section below the legacy surface; no schema/write/mutation behavior was added.
- Current parity slice: `/sales-plan` was revised after Reports. It restores the legacy amber/orange Sales Plan shell, LME reference strip, local month/group/channel filters, CSV placement, white KPI cards, editable-looking 12-column plan table shell, indigo product-analysis table with footer totals, and yellow remaining-to-lock table with totals. Add/remove/lock/edit persistence remains disabled/read-only until sales-plan schema, stock reservation, permission, audit, and rollback design are approved.
- Current parity slice: `/dashboard` visual shell was revised after Sales Plan. It restores the legacy dark period/filter bar, purple/pink hero, slate-blue dashboard container, six gradient KPI cards, chart/aging/channel/quick-insight cluster, alert bar, top supplier/customer rankings, trend/group panels, and four separate Purchase/Sales/Finance/Stock business blocks using the existing read payload only. Dashboard data parity follow-up remains queued for server-side filters, aging buckets, cash composition, stock-by-branch/group, and richer chart datasets.
- Current parity slice: `/purchase/bills` and `/sales/bills` were revised after Dashboard. Purchase restores the legacy blue list shell, KPI strip, action placement, dense status/type/VAT/creator/action table while preserving existing purchase GET/POST/PATCH. Sales restores the amber pending-sale warning, emerald list shell, disabled recalc/export/create controls, KPI strip, GP/margin/received/VAT/creator/action table, and extends `/api/sales/bills` only with existing read fields. No sales write endpoint, schema change, destructive action, print, supplier swap, cancel, delete, sync, repair, or bulk mutation was added.
- Current purchase bills UI follow-up: `/purchase/bills` now moves the purchase bill heading/description into the global topbar title and removes the duplicate blue heading card from the page body. The sidebar menu label stays short as `บิลรับซื้อ`.
- Current global layout follow-up: active Next pages now render a compact breadcrumb row under the topbar, using navigation section and route labels while keeping long page-specific topbar titles out of the breadcrumb trail.
- Current purchase bill detail UI follow-up: `/purchase/bills/[id]` now sends the loaded bill `doc_no` to the global topbar as `รายละเอียดบิลรับซื้อ {doc_no}` and removes the duplicate detail heading/subcopy from the page body.
- Current purchase bill detail/schema cleanup: `/purchase/bills/[id]` no longer shows legacy fields that are not in the purchase bill form (`เลขอ้างอิง Supplier`, `ช่องทางซื้อ`, `ที่มา`, `เบอร์โทร`, and separate warehouse display), and labels the bill date as `วันที่สร้างรายการ` from `created_at`. `purchase_bills.contact_phone`, `purchase_bills.channel_id`, and the duplicate document `date` column are removed from the purchase bill payload/model/migration because the form no longer collects them and the document number already carries the document period.
- Current redirected work slice: `/purchase/po-buy` create/add-list is implemented after user paused Anomaly/GL follow-ups. It follows legacy `view-poBuy`: blue `+ PO Buy ใหม่` opens the amber purpose modal, supports Delivery vs Costing-only, multi-line product rows, live totals, and server-generated meaningful ids/doc numbers through `POST /api/purchase/po-buy`. PO issue time and document number are stamped/generated server-side at save time; the modal does not show editable PO issue date or document-number fields. The old purchase-channel input is removed from this flow because it duplicates branch/location usage. After the branch cleanup follow-up, the modal uses required active `branches`, writes `branch_id` directly, leaves `warehouse_id`/`channel_id` null for new rows, and generates new numbers as `POB{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN`. Edit/cancel/move-purpose and allocation side effects remain deferred.
- Current PO Buy UX follow-up: the `/purchase/po-buy` create modal Supplier field is now a searchable combobox over active suppliers. Users can type supplier name/code/id, choose a filtered row, or press Enter to select the first match; the saved payload still sends the validated `supplierId`.
- Current master-data follow-up: business-facing master codes and matching business IDs are now canonical uppercase. `/master-data/salespersons` uses `SA001`-`SA999`; manual input like `sales1`/`s1`/`sa1` normalizes to `SA001`, and new records use the generated `SA...` value for both `id` and `code`. `/master-data/suppliers` uses `SU0001`-`SU99999`; legacy-style `SUP1`/`s1`/`su1` inputs normalize to `SU0001`, and new records use the generated `SU...` value for both `id` and `code`.
- Dev-target data migration `20260520143001_uppercase_master_party_codes.sql` has remapped existing salespersons and suppliers so `id = code` in uppercase, changed supplier foreign keys to `ON UPDATE CASCADE`, and updated known `sales_id`/`supplier_id` references with zero orphan references after verification.
- Current supplier import follow-up: `/master-data/suppliers` now has an Excel import path that accepts the same `.xlsx` workbook produced by the supplier export sheet `ผู้ขาย`. Import is all-or-nothing, validates rows before write, maps `ผู้ดูแล` back to active salespersons by id/code/name, uses uppercase `SU...` as both `id` and `code`, and keeps address data in form/export/import while hiding the address column from the on-screen supplier table.
- Current customer/supplier round-trip follow-up: `/master-data/customers` now has Import Excel UI and `/api/master-data/customers/import`, matching the supplier import pattern. Customer and supplier imports accept the workbook produced by their export sheets, validate through the shared form schema, upsert by canonical business code/id, and generate new `CUS...` or `SU...` codes when a template row leaves the code blank.
- Current reference master cleanup: `/master-data/bank-names` and `/master-data/channels` no longer expose business code fields in the table/form/API response surface. Dev-target `public.bank_names`, `public.purchase_channels`, and `public.sales_channels` no longer keep separate `code` columns; their hidden primary keys remain for FK stability. Backup tables were created as `maintenance.reference_code_removal_backup_20260520090736_*`.
- Current supplier international-address follow-up: `public.suppliers` now has additive international address fields (`country_code`, `address_line1`, `address_line2`, `address_city`, `address_state_region`, `address_postal_code_intl`). `/master-data/suppliers` moves the domestic/foreign selector into the address section, requires visible country + address line 1 + city for foreign suppliers, keeps `country_code` internal/export-only when available, clears Thai address hierarchy fields for foreign writes, keeps `ที่อยู่เต็ม/หมายเหตุที่อยู่` as address metadata, removes the general supplier note field from the modal/export/import surface, and changes `ธนาคารรับเงิน` to a dropdown from `/master-data/bank-names`.
- Current supplier CSV replacement follow-up: dev-target supplier master was replaced from `nsscrap permission and master data   - ผู้ขาย.csv` as the source of truth. The import generated uppercase `SU0001...` ids/codes for 1,871 active CSV rows, preserved 17 referenced old rows as inactive to keep transaction FKs valid, added missing bank masters (`พร้อมเพย์`, `เงินสด`, `ธนาคารออมสิน`, `ธนาคารเพื่อการเกษตรและสหกรณ์การเกษตร`), defaulted blank owners to `PLOY`, and backed up the old supplier/FK state in `maintenance.supplier_replace_backup_20260520072518` and `maintenance.supplier_replace_fk_backup_20260520072518`. Follow-up repair restored bank/account values from the backup where the CSV was blank and name matching was reliable, and cleared all supplier tax IDs so the exported workbook can be keyed by users.
- Current supplier receiving-account follow-up: supplier credit term/limit has been removed from the supplier UI/API/Prisma model and dropped from `public.suppliers` after backup. Supplier receiving accounts now live in `public.supplier_bank_accounts` with `payment_method`: `เงินสด` stores no bank/account detail, while `โอนเงิน` requires a bank and digit-only account number. Dev-target normalization split 1,470 transfer rows, 282 cash rows, and 8 multi-account suppliers; cash markers were stripped from stored bank/account fields.
- Current supplier cleanup follow-up: unused `public.suppliers.notes` was dropped after backup `maintenance.supplier_notes_drop_backup_20260520121005`; supplier address metadata remains in `address` as `ที่อยู่เต็ม/หมายเหตุที่อยู่`.
- Current supplier cleanup follow-up: unused `public.suppliers.version` was dropped after backup `maintenance.supplier_version_drop_backup_20260520121147`; supplier saves do not currently implement row-version optimistic locking.
- Current supplier receiving-account follow-up: account-level `branch_code` was added to `public.supplier_bank_accounts` after backup `maintenance.supplier_bank_accounts_branch_code_backup_20260520122022`; supplier modal now stores `รหัสสาขา` inside each receiving account row.
- Current master-data follow-up: `/master-data/salespersons` form now auto-generates code and no longer exposes note, commission, or base salary fields. The target `salespersons` DB model no longer keeps `note`, `commission_pct`, or `base_salary`.
- Current master-data cleanup follow-up: customer master now follows the supplier-style party/address form and no longer uses contact person, bank account, or general notes. Product units/types no longer expose/store code; channels is now `ช่องทางขาย` over sales channels only; expense categories no longer use code or parent category; machines no longer use maintenance status and now use `/master-data/machine-types` as the DB-backed type source. Topbar branch selector now reads active `branches` through `/api/branches` instead of a placeholder/warehouse source, respecting current user branch scope where available. Supplier account copy uses a small inline SVG icon button with no CDN/dependency.
- i18n is recorded as a future separate architecture batch, not part of the current master-data cleanup, because it affects app-wide copy, validation messages, routing, and locale fallback.
- Current parity slice: `/sales/stock-issue` was revised after Transaction Bills. It restores the legacy amber/orange Pending Sale hero, four KPI cards, status filter, weight/cost/estimated-sale columns, status wording, and disabled convert/edit/cancel action shell. `/api/sales/stock-issue` only gained read status filtering and derived item quantity; no create/edit/convert/cancel/delete write behavior, stock-ledger reversal, or sales-bill generation was added.
- Current parity slice: `/purchase/payments` and `/sales/receipts` were revised after Pending Sale. The shared money-movement component now restores the first legacy Payment/Receipt Voucher shells with rose/emerald heroes, create CTAs, KPI cards, date/account/search filters, outstanding bill selector with party/amount prefill, voucher net summary, dense history table, footer totals, and disabled view/print action shell. Existing single-voucher POST behavior remains unchanged; multi-bill voucher, split accounts, print document generation, edit/delete/reverse, and allocation writes remain deferred.
- Current layout task: sidebar navigation scroll preservation was revised after user feedback. `AppNavigation` now restores saved sidebar scroll only once, avoids treating missing session storage as `0`, and suppresses programmatic scroll saves while still scrolling the selected route into view when needed.
- Current parity slice: `/purchase/receipt-vouchers` was revised after the sidebar task. It restores the first legacy Receipt Voucher read/print surface: blue info banner, compact search/create toolbar, KPI strip, seller/tax ID/purchase bill/weight/amount table columns, print/edit/delete action cluster with edit/delete disabled, legacy empty state, footer totals, and read-only print preview from existing DB fields. The API only exposes existing receipt voucher print/detail fields; create/edit/delete/save, purchase-bill prefill, company-profile print header wiring, and sync/write semantics remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/petty-advance` was revised after Receipt Vouchers. It restores the legacy purple/pink hero, five KPI cards, Top 10 recipient panel, compact filter/action bar, type/status chips, used/returned/remaining/action table shape, return modal date/account/notes fields, and read-only detail modal with summary plus return history. Existing create/edit/return writes are preserved; delete, expense allocation, linked-expense schema assumptions, and destructive cleanup remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/bill-swap-history` was revised after Petty Advance. It restores the legacy rose/pink before-VAT report shell, KPI strip, supplier/product/bill search, before/after supplier names, derived weight, old/new price columns, old/new before-VAT amount columns, diff coloring, footer totals, and legacy empty state. The API only adds read joins for supplier names and purchase bill doc numbers; full legacy oldItems/newItems parity remains deferred because the target schema stores compact row fields.
- Current parity slice: Production report polish was revised after Bill Swap History. `/production/wip-report` now has age-days sorting/highlighting, `/production/report` has the legacy product output summary block, `/production/yield-loss-report` has the amber explanation and P&L impact card trio, and `/production/machine-utilization` has the formula banner plus Est.Hrs/ต้นทุน columns. All changes are read-only/report polish; branch/machine/status server filters, exact multi-output aggregation, loss reason wiring, and production mutations remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/daily/transfer` was revised after Production report polish. It restores the legacy compact filter card, direction account placeholders, clear-filter button, all/today/7-days/month period chips, inline count/total summary, rounded table shell, and explicit edit/delete action column while preserving the existing create/edit transfer POST flow. Delete remains disabled until a reviewed DELETE/tombstone/bank-statement cleanup path exists in the active Next API.
- Current parity slice: `/stock/transfer` was revised after Daily Transfer. It restores the legacy compact filter bar with search/date/from-branch/to-branch controls, all/today/7-days/month period chips, inline count/weight summary, blue create CTA, seven-column table with disabled cancel shell, and red/emerald source-destination modal panels with sender/receiver/notes fields. Existing stock-ledger POST behavior is preserved; cancel/tombstone and sender/receiver persistence remain deferred until schema/write semantics are reviewed.
- Current parity slice: `/pending-sales` was revised after Stock Transfer. It restores the legacy LME Reference Pricing form-like inputs, disabled LME save shell, LME percent details with product count and input-style percent fields, active client-side CSV export, formula parity for gain/diff using `avgPriceRemain`, and the Patch 28 `ตารางรอขาย` section with formula explanation, five KPI cards, shortage highlighting, footer totals, and CSV export. This remains read/report only; LME persistence, matching/allocation writes, and sales-plan locks remain deferred.
- Current parity slice: `/anomaly-detector` was revised after Pending Sales. It restores category count tags, severity-colored group badges/titles/counts, legacy-like hero-to-KPI ordering, compact As-of read-only toolbar, and honest checklist copy for the 18 active rule groups. Legacy 40-check coverage and record-level jump/highlight remain deferred until missing read rules and target route highlight contracts are designed.
- Current parity slice: `/dashboard` data parity follow-up was revised after Anomaly Detector. The dashboard date range controls now request `/api/dashboard?from=&to=`, AR/AP aging buckets are computed server-side, cash composition includes FCD/AR/AP/OD/net cash, stock-by-branch and stock-by-group use stock ledger balances, and monthly trend rows drive dashboard chart panels. Branch/supplier/customer/product/group server filters and historical monthly baseline merge remain follow-up work.
- Current parity slice: `/dashboard` filter parity follow-up was revised after the data payload pass. Dashboard branch/supplier/customer/product/group controls now reload `/api/dashboard` with query parameters and the server filters purchase/sales KPIs and analysis rows read-only. The API now exposes active branches/groups/products as filter options; historical monthly baseline merge and fuller supplier/customer option lists beyond visible in-period rows remain follow-up work.
- Current parity slice: `/dashboard` historical data follow-up was revised after server filters. The dashboard now merges `historical_monthly` rows into revenue/COGS/expense totals and monthly trend rows (`pnl/revenue`, `pnl/cogs`, and `expense`) and shows actual merged amounts/row count in the historical indicator. Supplier/customer filter options now come from active master data rather than only top in-period rows. Remaining dashboard work is design-level statutory/GL reconciliation, not a safe read-only UI parity patch.
- Current unmapped legacy slice: remote-legacy-only views are being restored after the sidebar fix. `/dual-costing/waiting-allocations`, `/dual-costing/cost-allocation-ledger`, and `/dual-costing/report` now have dedicated read-only Next pages/APIs and sidebar entries. `/finance-accounting/asset-overview` now restores `trackAssetOverview` / Net Worth Track Asset as a management/read dark-shell baseline from existing Financial Dashboard + Cash & Others sources. No allocation write, reverse, stock mutation, GL posting, statutory P&L, or statutory balance-sheet behavior is added. The current remote-snapshot unmapped list is now closed; remaining items are design-level follow-ups.
- Current parity slice: Batch D Group C was revised after Company Profile and pushed as `dcfa1c1`. It restores Match Log's legacy `📋` info box, PO Sell filter shell, visible-row summary cards, and disabled Reverse action column; Deal Margin's match-status donut/legend, `PO Sell`/`Sell Qty` table shape, and legacy empty state; and Compare Margin's legacy first-screen order with date filters/row stats reduced after the core cards. No reverse/allocation mutation is enabled; Deal Margin `sellQty` is exposed as current `trading_deals.matched_qty` and documented in OpenAPI until normalized PO Sell allocation logs are designed.
- Current follow-up slice: `/stock/ledger` row detail modal was implemented after UI-D3 and pushed as `181a2e5`. It turns the legacy `อ่าน` action into a read-only modal using the existing ledger row payload; duplicate/orphan cleanup stays disabled and no stock write behavior is added.
- Current follow-up slice: PO Buy branch/warehouse cleanup is implemented. `/purchase/po-buy` create flow now uses required active `branches` instead of `warehouses`, generates new document numbers as `POB{branchCode}{YYMM}-NNNN`, writes `branch_id` directly, and leaves `warehouse_id`/`channel_id` null for new PO Buy rows. The active `/master-data/warehouses` page/API/config has been removed; `/master-data/branches` is the business-facing `สาขา / คลัง` master. Dev-target branch IDs were remapped after backup to `BR001/code 01/สมุทรสาคร` and `BR002/code 02/นครสวรรค์`; old `BR003` references were cleared from public `branch_id` columns and `user_profiles.branch_ids`. The physical `warehouses` table is retained only for existing stock/purchase-bill history until a separate stock-location migration is designed.
- Current master-data cleanup slice: supplier receiving-account payment methods now come from `/master-data/payment-methods` instead of hardcoded options. Dev-target `bank_names` no longer contains `เงินสด`/`เงินโอน`, `payment_methods` no longer stores a code column, payment method names are bilingual such as `เงินสด (Cash)`, and supplier account rows use canonical `เงินโอน` while still accepting legacy `โอนเงิน` import text.
- Current master-data cleanup slice: product and machine parent menu rows are now submenu toggles only. The working pages are labeled `/master-data/products` = `รายการสินค้า` and `/master-data/machines` = `รายการเครื่องจักร`, matching the user's request that `สินค้า` and `เครื่องจักร` act as submenu groups.
- Current master-data cleanup slice: `currencies.code` and `overseas_remittance_purposes.code` were removed from dev-target after maintenance backups. Currency now uses internal `id` derived from uppercase `symbol`, and foreign-finance APIs still return a compatibility `code` value from the currency symbol for existing form consumers. Remittance purpose UI/API now exposes name/status only.
- Current system cleanup slice: Audit Log / Activity Log redesign was implemented and pushed as `7a07c7d`. Dev-target now has separate append-only `app_audit_logs` and `app_activity_logs` tables with RLS, `system.activity.view`, and append-only update/delete guards. Next writes user-management audit events to `app_audit_logs`, records page/branch activity through `/api/activity`, and `/admin/audit` reads a unified feed from the two new tables through the existing `/api/admin/auth-events` compatibility endpoint. Legacy `app_auth_events`, `audit_logs`, and deletion log tables are retained as history/compatibility sources, not the new source of truth.
- Current master-data cleanup slice: `/master-data/accounts`, `/master-data/machines`, and `/master-data/production-lines` no longer expose business code fields. Dev-target `public.accounts`, `public.production_machines`, and `public.production_lines` dropped `code` after maintenance backups. Branch references on accounts/machines/production lines now use branch ids while showing branch names, and user-facing labels are `สาขา/คลัง`.
- Current master-data import/export slice: customer phone is optional for round-trip import/export, supplier export includes `รหัสผู้ดูแล` and robust receiving-account text, and `/master-data/products` now has import support. Product business codes were normalized in dev-target from legacy group codes to `SKU001...` after backup while preserving product internal ids for transaction references.
- Current purchase-bill modal follow-up: `/purchase/bills` no longer shows modal fields for `เลขที่บิล`, `วันที่`, `คลัง`, `ช่องทางซื้อ`, `เซลที่ดูแล`, VAT type, or the VAT checkbox in the bill-info section. Purchase bill numbers and the create timestamp are system-generated on save, new bill document dates derive from `created_at` in Bangkok time, branch selection is labeled `สาขา/คลัง` and shows branch names without codes, the supplier field is searchable, saved `sales_id` derives from supplier master data, and item rows now wrap so `Gross` and later quantity/price fields start on the next line under product/PO.
- Current tax config follow-up: dev-target now has configurable `vat_settings` and `wht_settings` master/config tables seeded with VAT 7% and WHT 3%. `/admin/system-settings` manages both active rates under the System module. `/purchase/bills` reads the active VAT percent from DB, displays that percent in the modal summary, calculates VAT from that rate instead of hardcoded `7`, and stores the rate used in `purchase_bills.vat_rate_percent`. `/purchase/payments` now reads active WHT config for supplier payments, displays WHT as read-only, and recomputes WHT in the API before save.
- Current UI pattern note: legacy-style list tables should keep the white rounded shadow card, compact zebra rows, slate header, and slate row separators as the default table surface unless the legacy page has a more specific color/header pattern. Branch dropdowns should display branch names only; do not show branch codes in dropdown labels. Keep branch codes stored and visible only where the branch master or document-numbering logic explicitly needs them.
- Current navigation cleanup: per user request on 2026-05-22, the `การเงินต่างประเทศ` / Foreign Finance category is hidden from the active Next sidebar and report index because it is not in active use/development. Existing `/finance/foreign/*` pages and APIs are retained in code as future baselines; money-moving writes remain deferred.
- Current route retirement: per user request on 2026-05-22, `/stock/customer-return` has been removed from the active Next app because it is not used. The sidebar item, page route, API route, OpenAPI path/schema, and shared Customer Return form/schema branch were removed; no stock history or database tables were changed.
- Current purchase-bill DB cleanup: `public.purchase_bill_items` is added as the relational line table for purchase bill products, backfilled from `purchase_bills.items`, and `/api/purchase/bills` plus active purchase-item reports now read/write line rows. The old `purchase_bills.items` JSONB column has been removed from the target schema.
- Current AP/payment follow-up: `/api/purchase/payments` now refreshes linked `purchase_bills.paid_amount`, `payable_balance`, and `status` from active payment rows in the same transaction. Creating a purchase bill still creates AP via `payable_balance`; it does not create a payment row until the Supplier Payment Voucher is saved. Data dictionary: `docs/data-dictionary/purchase-bills.md`; local dev-target schema-only dump: `reports/db_audit/dev_target_schema_20260522.sql`.

## Next Required Batch

`Batch F: Finance and Debt`

Tasks:

1. F0 legacy inventory and DB mapping - docs checkpoint first
2. F1 AR page/API - next implementation slice
3. F2 AP polish - existing AP route/page needs filter/sort/pagination/export/detail review
4. F3 Bank Statement - next read/reconciliation baseline after AR/AP
5. F4-F6 Cash Position, Supplier Advance, Customer Advance - read baseline first, no allocation/write rule guesses

## Tailwind v4 Migration Status

Status: completed and pushed in the TW4 checkpoint.

Changes:

- `apps/next` now uses `tailwindcss@4.3.0` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.3.0`.
- `apps/next/postcss.config.cjs` now uses the Tailwind v4 PostCSS plugin.
- `apps/next/src/app/globals.css` now uses `@import "tailwindcss";` and CSS-first `@theme` tokens.
- Removed `apps/next/tailwind.config.ts`; active app theme tokens now live in CSS.
- Root `package.json` still keeps Tailwind v3 for old Vue tooling; this is intentional until old Vue tooling is removed or upgraded.

Validation passed:

- `npm ls tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next`

## Playwright MCP Status

Status: configured and pushed.

Changes:

- Added `playwright` server to project-level `.mcp.json`.
- Command: `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --headless`
- Documented the setup in `docs/migration/10-environment-status.md`.

Validation passed:

- `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.mcp.json','utf8')); console.log('mcp json ok')"`
- `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@latest --help`

Runtime note:

- Restart Codex before expecting `/mcp` or MCP resources/tools to show the new `playwright` server.

## Agent Rules Refactor Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `55c81c7`.

Changes:

- `AGENTS.md` is now a short entrypoint with hard rules, required reading, rule links, environment shortlist, and validation baseline.
- Detailed rules moved to `docs/agent-rules/`.
- `docs/migration/00-doc-index.md` now lists the agent rule documents.

Validation passed in its own checkpoint.

## System Map and API Contract Baseline Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `5ad3ab2`.

Changes:

- Added `docs/migration/18-next-system-sitemap.md`.
- Added `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Updated `docs/migration/17-next-remaining-modules-progress.md` with PRE0/PRE1 execution logs.

Current findings:

- `/stock/balance` has an active read baseline and has been revised in the post-SYS legacy UI parity pass.
- `/stock/ledger` has a read baseline but still needs query/pagination/running-balance polish.
- Most main dashboard/reporting and finance-accounting routes remain placeholder coverage.

Validation:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npx --yes @redocly/cli lint docs/api/openapi.yaml` passed validity check with skeleton-level warnings for missing `operationId`, tag descriptions, and some 4XX responses.

## Current Priority Queue

1. Batch F: Finance and Debt
2. Batch T: Tracking 360
3. Batch D: Dual Costing / Trading / PO
4. Batch FF: Foreign Finance
5. Batch A: Finance / Accounting
6. Batch M: Main Dashboards and Operational Control
7. Batch SYS: System and Cleanup

Post-SYS UI parity priority after the first 10 route audit now includes a dedicated Daily Reports / รายงานประจำวัน group:

1. Finish Finance and Debt: `/finance/supplier-advance`, `/finance/customer-advance`
2. Stock parity is closed for active routes; `/stock/customer-return` is retired from the active app per user request.
3. Daily Reports / รายงานประจำวัน: `/owner-daily`, `/daily-report`, with `/dashboard` checked where shared daily-report cards overlap
4. Tracking 360
5. Dual Costing / Trading / PO

## Batch S Stock Status

Status: completed and pushed in checkpoint `42ce82b`.

Implemented in this checkpoint:

- Added stock balance, status convert, grade convert, stock count adjust, and customer return API/page baselines.
- Hardened stock OpenAPI contract for touched stock endpoints with operation IDs, real query parameters, request schemas, and stock response schemas.
- Adjusted stock write forms to support direct `?new=1` URLs for form smoke testing and resumable links.
- Ran authenticated browser/API smoke with the provided dev user; credentials were used only in the browser session and were not stored in docs or code.

Verification already run:

- Desktop browser smoke: all six stock pages returned HTTP 200 with no login/error state.
- Mobile browser smoke at 390x844: stock read pages and write forms rendered without visible errors.
- Authenticated API smoke: all six stock APIs returned HTTP 200.
- Write form smoke: `/stock/status-convert?new=1`, `/stock/convert?new=1`, `/stock/adjust?new=1`, and `/stock/customer-return?new=1` rendered title, fields, cancel, and save controls; no submit was performed.
- `npx --yes @redocly/cli lint docs/api/openapi.yaml --max-problems 200` passed validity with existing skeleton warnings outside the stock batch.

Final local validation:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.

Commit:

- `42ce82b feat: add stock module baselines` pushed to `main`.

Known carry-over from Batch S:

- Stock ledger row detail modal remains a follow-up.
- Field-level validation messages on stock write forms remain a follow-up; server-side Zod validation is active.
- Reconciliation query/report for grade convert and count adjust remains a follow-up.
- Void/reversal and final WAC/cost-source policy remain broader stock hardening work.

## Post-SYS Stock UI Parity Slice

Status: completed locally; commit/push pending.

Current checkpoint:

- `/stock/status-convert` is being revised back toward the legacy purple/pink compact surface: legacy title, usage tip, search placeholder, `+ ปรับสถานะใหม่` action, no summary cards, 10-column table, status-flow chips, reason/created-by columns, and legacy empty state.
- `/stock/customer-return` is being revised back toward the legacy purple/pink compact surface: legacy title, 3 KPI cards, search + branch filter + disabled CSV control, 11-column table, return status/action cells, guidance box, and legacy empty state.
- API changes are display/read-only additions only: status convert rows now expose `note` and `createdBy`; customer return rows now expose `branchId`/`warehouseId` for unambiguous UI filtering.
- No POST/write semantics, stock policy, WAC policy, customer-return send-back semantics, schema migrations, or permission rules were changed in this slice.

Validation:

- `npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Browser QA:

- Authenticated main Playwright checked `/stock/status-convert` and `/stock/customer-return` at `http://localhost:3100` on desktop 1365x900 and mobile 390x844; both APIs returned 200, no page-level horizontal overflow, no new console warnings/errors, and legacy markers/columns/cards/actions were present.
- Subagent unauth smoke confirmed both routes redirect to login, both APIs return 401, login desktop/mobile has no horizontal overflow, and no related console/page/network errors were reported.

Next:

- Commit and push the stock parity slice.
- Start Daily Reports / รายงานประจำวัน: `/owner-daily`, `/daily-report`, with `/dashboard` checked where shared daily-report cards overlap.

## Batch F Finance and Debt Status

Status: active batch started after checkpoint `a2fd1ba`.

Current scope:

- F1 AR read/report baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F2 AP polish is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F3 Bank Statement read/reconciliation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F4 Cash Position aggregation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F5 Supplier Advance read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F6 Customer Advance read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- F7 Finance QA checkpoint is documented and pushed.
- Money-moving writes remain out of scope until reconciliation and allocation rules are clear.

## Batch T Tracking 360 Status

Status: active batch started after finance checkpoint `1c0b5c7`.

Current scope:

- T0 inventory and DB mapping is documented and pushed.
- T1 Customer Tracking read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T2 Supplier Tracking polish is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T3 Product Tracking read/report baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- T4 Tracking QA Batch passed after correcting Product Tracking slow movers, and is pushed.
- D0 Dual Costing / Trading / PO legacy inventory and DB mapping is complete and pushed.
- D1 PO Sell read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- D2 PO Buy read-only polish is implemented, validated, and pushed. Write flows remain deferred.
- D2a PO Buy create/add-list is implemented and pushed; follow-up refinement makes issue timestamp server-owned and replaces channel/branch inputs with `สาขา/คลัง`.
- D3 Trading Dashboard read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. Dashboard remains read-only.
- D4 Trading Matching read-only polish is implemented, validated, and pushed. Write/reverse/recalc actions remain deferred.
- D5 Cost Pool read-derived baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. UI keeps the legacy amber warning band, blue/orange/purple cost cards, summary cards, filters, export, table, and read-only detail modal; write allocation remains deferred.
- D6 Cost Allocator read-only simulation baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. UI keeps the legacy purple step-card flow; confirm/write remains disabled until allocation logs and reversal rules are designed.
- D7a Match Log read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reads `trading_deals` as current source because normalized allocation logs are not designed yet; reverse/write remains deferred.
- D7b Deal Margin read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reads `trading_deals` matched sales/purchase amounts and preserves the legacy purple/pink gross margin card layout.
- D7c Compare Margin read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It compares deal-side `trading_deals` with stock-side `sales_bills` revenue/COGS and preserves the legacy blue/purple/emerald diff-card layout.
- D8 Dual Costing QA checkpoint is implemented, validated, and pushed. It fixed PO Sell date filters, Trading Matching filter scope, Cost Pool business-facing display refs/status options, Cost Allocator modes, Deal Margin match status, Compare Margin stock scope, and PO Sell OpenAPI row names.
- FF0 Foreign Finance legacy inventory and DB mapping is completed and pushed. FF1 FX Rate manage baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed.
- Tracking routes must use active Next app only; legacy/Vue tracking views are source material.
- Keep T1-T3 read/report baselines first; no write flows in tracking pages.
- DB design preference clarified: use meaningful business-facing codes/running document numbers for user-visible references; keep UUID/opaque IDs internal only.
- Permission carry-over: trading/dual-costing currently uses `finance.cash.view`; split into dedicated trading/cost/profit permissions in a later auth batch instead of changing guards ad hoc.

Initial F0 findings:

- Legacy/Vue finance-debt pages: AR, AP, Bank Statement, Cash Position, Supplier Advance, Customer Advance.
- Related money write flows already exist in daily/purchase/sales surfaces: supplier payments, customer receipts, petty advances/returns, transfers, payment approval, and transaction ledger.
- Target DB mapping: `sales_bills`, `receipts`, `purchase_bills`, `payments`, `bank_statement`, `accounts`, plus party and branch lookup tables.
- Bank statement rows are shared side effects from payment/receipt/expense/transfer/petty flows, so bank reconciliation should be read-first before any write changes.

Initial FF0 findings:

- Active Next foreign finance routes started as placeholders: International Transfer, Overseas Receipt, FX Rate, FCD Ledger, FX Gain/Loss, and Bank Reconciliation. FF1 promotes FX Rate to a manage baseline.
- Existing support tables are `accounts`, `bank_statement`, `currencies`, `fx_gain_loss`, `overseas_recipients`, and `overseas_remittance_purposes`.
- FF1 adds historical `fx_rates`. There is still no dedicated `fcd_ledger` table, no confirmed `intl_transfers`/`overseas_receipts` tables, and no `bank_imports` table in the active Prisma schema.
- FF4 FCD Ledger read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It derives from FCD/foreign-currency accounts and bank statement rows without mutating bank rows.
- FCD Ledger does not infer foreign movement from THB bank rows or current currency rates. Foreign movement stays zero unless future ITF/ORC source tables provide true foreign amounts; opening foreign balance comes from `accounts.opening_balance`.
- FF5 FX Gain/Loss read baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It reads realized rows from `fx_gain_loss` only and does not auto-post.
- FF6 Bank Reconciliation read/design baseline is implemented, validated, and pushed. It shows ERP bank rows and disables import/match writes until normalized import/match state exists.
- FF2/FF3 International Transfer and Overseas Receipt read/form baselines are implemented, validated, and pushed. They intentionally do not write `bank_statement`, post FX gain/loss, complete, approve, or reverse until dedicated transaction schemas and idempotency/reversal rules exist.
- FF7 Foreign Finance QA checkpoint is implemented, validated, and pushed. All six foreign finance APIs returned 200 in browser smoke; type-check, lint, build, OpenAPI validity, and diff check passed. OpenAPI still has the existing 113 skeleton warnings outside this batch.
- User-facing refs should be `ITF*`, `ORC*`, `ref_no`, account code/account no, and currency symbol/code; do not expose UUID/ref_id as the primary display.
- A0 Finance / Accounting overview is implemented locally as a docs checkpoint. All 18 routes are still placeholders; active schema supports management baselines for cash, AR/AP, stock value, assets, loans, equity, and opening balance, but GL/statutory posting remains deferred. Recommended next slice is A6 Fixed Assets read baseline before dashboards/statements.

Next concrete task:

1. Validate, commit, and push A0 Finance / Accounting overview.
2. Preserve legacy/Vue visual baseline first: colors, cards, panels, table density, button placement, and labels.
3. Use sub agents by default for Playwright/browser QA, and split read-only scouting/contract review into parallel sub agents when work can be separated cleanly.

## Operating Model

Before each module batch:

1. Read the module overview and legacy source touchpoints.
2. Break the module into page-level tasks.
3. For each page, document the expected fields, buttons, modals, APIs, DB tables, validation, pagination/sort/export, and Playwright checks.
4. Implement in reviewable slices.
5. Update the relevant tracker before moving to the next slice.
6. Commit/push after each meaningful checkpoint.

Use sub agents only for bounded parallel work:

- legacy flow search
- route/API inventory
- independent page audit
- Playwright smoke verification
- isolated docs or page/API implementation with clear file ownership

For Playwright work, use a sub agent by default so browser QA can run in parallel while the main agent continues implementation or integration. The main agent must define the exact Playwright scope and then integrate findings before committing.

Close sub agents when their task is integrated, no longer needed, blocked, overlapping, or after a batch checkpoint leaves them with no remaining work. Do not leave reminder agents open unless the user explicitly requested one for the active task list.

## Handoff Checklist

At every checkpoint, update docs as if a new session will start from only the repository:

1. Current batch/task/page
2. Exact partial work and files touched
3. Commands already run and result
4. Validation still required
5. Next concrete task
6. Whether to continue immediately or pause for discussion
