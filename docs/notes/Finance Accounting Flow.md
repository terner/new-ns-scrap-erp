# Finance Accounting Flow

เอกสารนี้เป็น source หลักของหมวด `Finance / Accounting` ใน active Next app. สถานะปัจจุบันของหมวดนี้เป็น management/report baseline พร้อม controlled write flow สำหรับ asset lifecycle เบื้องต้น ได้แก่ ทะเบียนทรัพย์สิน, ค่าเสื่อมราคา, และจำหน่ายทรัพย์สิน. หมวดนี้ยังไม่ใช่ GL/statutory accounting close system. สำหรับสรุปแบบรายเมนูทั้ง `การเงิน & หนี้` และ `Finance / Accounting` ให้ดู [[Finance And Accounting Menu Summary]]

## Shared Boundary

- permission กลางของ API อ่านคือ `finance.financials.view`
- write action ที่เปิดแล้วใช้ `finance.financials.manage` และต้องมี validation/reversal policy เฉพาะหน้า
- Asset Register, Depreciation, และ Asset Disposal เปิด write flow เฉพาะ asset lifecycle; GL journal, statutory posting, bank/receipt posting, และ period close ยัง deferred
- ห้ามให้ report page เขียน `bank_statement`, `stock_ledger`, PB/SB status, AP/AR allocation, GL posting หรือ asset/loan/equity state จนกว่าจะมี write-flow + audit + reversal design แยก

## Page Semantics

| Page group | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Management financial statements | P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Financial Dashboard. These are report-derived statements from operational tables, not locked statutory statements yet. |
| Cash/working capital planning | Cash Flow Analysis, CF Forecast Calendar, Working Capital, Stock Finance, Profit Leak. These explain cash pressure, inventory/AR/AP days, stock finance risk and margin leakage. |
| Tax baseline | Tax / VAT / WHT reads transaction tax fields and tax calendar assumptions. It is not a filing ledger and has no filing lock/status today. |
| Asset baseline | Asset Register creates/maintains asset master, Depreciation posts/reverses monthly depreciation rows, Asset Disposal closes/reverses asset lifecycle using latest NBV, and Asset Overview remains read-only. |
| Loan/equity/opening/historical | Loan Contracts/Dashboard, Equity, Opening Balance, Historical Data read setup/support tables. Stock Opening is the approved write path; Excel import stages validated rows as Pending before the existing Apply flow creates stock ledger entries. |
| Period and posting policy | Accounting Periods is the target owner for month/year close states, soft close, lock, and reopen. Posting Rules is the readiness surface for source-to-account mapping before any GL/statutory posting is enabled. |

## Validation Rules

- Every report must state whether it uses actual, forecast, accrual or historical data.
- `asOf` reports use facts up to end-of-day of the selected date.
- period reports use document/business dates in the selected range unless a page explicitly states another basis.
- Currency, FCD, OD and FX treatment must not be silently mixed into THB totals without a documented conversion rule.
- FCD current accounts may have an OD limit. The limit, usage and remaining availability stay in the Statement currency unless a documented FX conversion rule explicitly produces a THB reporting value.
- Opening/historical/cutover data must be locked by a cutover approval policy before any write action is enabled.
- Asset and loan write flows need idempotency, audit trail, reversal and bank/GL side-effect policy before moving beyond read baseline.

## P&L and Cash Analysis Truth Contract 2026-07-17

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Canonical profit calculation | `buildPlStatement()` owns the management Profit Before Tax calculation. Operational documents remain the fact sources; Cash Flow Analysis and Financial Dashboard consume the calculated PBT instead of rebuilding a second formula. |
| Sales revenue | Use `sales_bills.total_amount - vat_amount` so the management revenue base is after header discount and before VAT. |
| Expense / cash basis | P&L uses `expenses.amount`. OCF uses active PMT `payments.net_amount` once, classified by `payment_approvals.source_type`; an Expense PMT is not subtracted again from `expenses.paid_at`, and duplicated `fee` / `bank_fee` storage is not double-counted. VAT/WHT settlement must not be folded into the P&L expense base. |
| Asset disposal | Approved, non-reversed `asset_disposals.gain_loss` is part of PBT and follows `disposal_date`; branch scope comes through the asset. |
| THB / FCD | Cash liquidity and projections include THB only. FCD is grouped by currency, uses opening balance until a foreign-movement source is approved, and is never added to a THB scalar. |
| OD | OD use is calculated per account before aggregation; available limit is `max(0, sum(limit) - sum(used))`. |
| AP projection | Purchase Bill uses document date under the current conservative policy. Do not claim contractual due-date forecasting until a PB/supplier credit-term source is confirmed. |
| Branch authorization | `ALL` means the effective authorized scope: Admin/Owner or a role explicitly marked `branch_scope=all` may see all branches; `own/custom` roles are intersected with `app_user_branch_access` and fail closed to an empty scope when no mapping exists. Report JSON, options, source queries, projection and XLSX use the same scope; forbidden requested branches return `403`. |
| Segment PBT | Stock/Trading remains a revenue/COGS supporting split only. Do not expose a segment PBT filter until shared expenses, depreciation, finance cost, FX and other income have an approved allocation policy. |

The two pages remain read-only management surfaces. They do not post GL, close periods, file tax, create receipts/payments, alter documents, or convert currencies.

## Open Gaps

- no normalized GL journal/posting layer yet
- no statutory close/period lock
- tax filing status and PP30/PND workflow are not implemented
- asset acquisition/disposal/depreciation GL posting remains deferred in this dev-scope batch; source lifecycle rows and reversals are enabled
- loan payment posting to bank statement/interest/principal split remains design-only
- opening balance writes remain disabled for accounting/AR/GL sections until cutover approval policy is defined; Stock Opening is the controlled inventory cutover path, writes `OPENING_STOCK_IN` transactionally, and creates/removes an idempotent unpaid AP shadow bill when `จ่ายแล้ว` is not selected
- Accounting Periods and Posting Rules are visible policy surfaces but do not yet enforce closed-period locks across all transaction write APIs
- monthly/yearly close needs the snapshot layer from [[Reporting History Snapshot Policy]] before dashboards/statements can be frozen reliably
