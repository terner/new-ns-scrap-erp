# Deal Margin Report Page Flow

## Scope

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Menu section | Dual Costing |
| Route | `/dual-costing/deal-margin` |
| Page | Deal Margin Report |
| Current Next | accepted read baseline |

## Canonical References

[[Dual Costing Flow]], [[page-flows/dual-costing-dual-costing-report|Dual Costing Report Page Flow]], [[page-flows/dual-costing-dual-costing-compare-margin|Compare Deal vs Stock Page Flow]]

## Legacy Baseline

Legacy view `view-dealMargin` is a visual management dashboard for deal profitability. It includes:

- total revenue, matched cost, gross margin, margin %
- top 5 deals by margin
- match status distribution chart
- filters by month/year/custom date/channel/product
- monthly performance breakdown
- table by PO Sell with sell qty, revenue, matched qty, avg cost, cost, margin, match status
- merged compare cards against stock/WAC totals
- CSV export

Legacy calculates deal side from PO Sell and match logs, while stock side comes from Sales Bills and WAC/total cost

## Target Flow

Deal Margin shows profitability of allocated deals using Deal Cost. It is a management lens and must not be confused with accounting GP

Target answers:

- which deals have high/low margin
- which deals are fully/partially/unmatched
- how matched cost compares by month/product/channel
- where Deal Cost differs from Stock/WAC margin

## Page Responsibilities

- Show deal revenue, matched cost, margin, margin %
- Show top deals and match status summary
- Support date/channel/product filters
- Show table with per-deal cost/margin details
- Export report rows
- Label data as Deal Cost

## Non-Responsibilities

- ไม่สร้าง match
- ไม่ reverse match
- ไม่แก้ PO Sell/Sales Bill
- ไม่แทน statutory P&L
- ไม่คำนวณ WAC ใหม่

## Lifecycle / Read Flow

| Step | User action | System result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | เปิดหน้า | โหลด deal margin rows |
| 2 | filter date/channel | แสดง rows และ summary ใหม่ |
| 3 | sort/drill visually | user ตรวจดีลที่ margin สูง/ต่ำ |
| 4 | export | ส่งออก XLSX/CSV ตาม current API |

## API / Data Contract

### Current API

- `GET /api/dual-costing/deal-margin`

Current query params:

- `from`
- `to`
- `channel`
- `format=xlsx`

Current source:

- `trading_deals`
- relations to `customers`, `products`, `sales_bills`

Required row fields:

- `docNo`
- `date`
- `customer`
- `channel`
- `product`
- `sellQty`
- `unitPrice`
- `totalRevenue`
- `matchedQty`
- `avgCost`
- `matchedCost`
- `margin`
- `marginPct`
- `statusMatch`

## Validation / Status Rules

- Cancelled deals excluded.
- `statusMatch` must distinguish `Fully`, `Partial`, `None`.
- Margin formula: `totalRevenue - matchedCost`.
- Margin percent formula: `margin / totalRevenue * 100`.
- Date filter must use same cutoff for table, summary, top deals, and export.

## Side Effects

Read-only. No mutation.

## Current Code Baseline

- Current API/page is implemented and protected by `finance.cash.view`.
- Current route uses `trading_deals` as accepted read baseline and supports XLSX export.

## Current Gap

- Current `channel` is simplified as `Trading Deal`.
- Future allocation ledger may replace or enrich `trading_deals` as source.
- Legacy month/year quick filters and richer visual breakdown may need parity review if user requests UI parity.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Legacy deal margin inspected
- [x] Current API identified
- [ ] Reconcile to durable allocation ledger
- [ ] Confirm date/channel/product filter parity
- [ ] Add drilldown to Allocation Ledger/Match Log where useful
