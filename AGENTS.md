# NS Scrap ERP Agent Rules

This project is an existing NS Scrap ERP system that must be rehabilitated and refactored, not rewritten blindly.

## Must Follow

- Use Thai for user-facing explanations unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Active implementation/deploy target is the Next.js app under `apps/next/`.
- Treat `old-apps/legacy/` and `old-apps/vue/` as source material only. Do not route to, import, or execute them from the active app.
- Use `dev-target` Supabase for development and schema work. Do not develop directly against `legacy-prod-source`.
- Never commit secrets, production dumps, raw sensitive exports, or `.env.local`.
- Do not store user passwords in application tables. Use `auth.users` as the authentication source of truth.
- Do not use destructive git commands or revert user changes unless explicitly requested.
- Git remote policy:
  - push to `new-origin` only unless the user explicitly says otherwise
  - `origin` / `https://github.com/sirimasth/ns-scrap-erp.git` is legacy read-only reference material only
  - never push, force-push, create branches, delete branches, open PRs, write tags, or otherwise mutate `origin` / `https://github.com/sirimasth/ns-scrap-erp.git`
  - use `origin` only for read operations such as fetch, log, diff, show, and checkout-to-inspect
  - if both remotes exist, verify the destination remote before push, branch deletion, or PR creation
- Update docs at every meaningful checkpoint as if the session can close at any time.
- Use a sub agent by default for Playwright/browser QA work; the main agent still defines scope and integrates findings.
- Split large refactors into reviewable batches with one clear module, transform, or behavior change per batch.
- During clone/migration batches, use `docs/design.md` as the active design convention source and keep legacy/Vue parity unless a difference is documented and approved.
- For every UI/page change in `apps/next/`, check these three inputs before editing:
  1. the business flow / requirement for that page,
  2. `docs/design.md`,
  3. the closest reference page in the active app.
- Do not patch UI from memory or from a loosely similar page alone. If `docs/design.md` and an existing page differ, follow `docs/design.md` unless an override is documented in `docs/migration/00-current-work.md`.
- For form/list/filter work, explicitly verify wording, field behavior, layout grouping, and control sizing against the relevant flow and reference page before claiming completion.
- For form field type decisions, map every field to the `Field Input Decision Matrix` in `docs/design.md` before choosing `text`, `number`, or `money pattern`.
- If a field looks numeric but represents money, identifier, or business code, do not infer the input type from appearance alone; use the matrix and the page flow.
- Do not change application code outside the intended business flow just to tolerate bad, legacy, or malformed data. If data violates the target contract, fix the data, migration, seed, or source-of-truth process instead of adding compatibility branches, fallback logic, skip-row handling, or silent coercion in runtime code.
- After a batch is validated, committed, and pushed, immediately start the next batch from `docs/migration/00-current-work.md` and the relevant tracker unless the user pauses, redirects, or the next step requires explicit approval for high-risk work.

## Required Reading

Before substantial work, read:
- `docs/migration/00-current-work.md`
- `docs/migration/00-doc-index.md`
- `docs/design.md`
- `REQUIREMENTS_TARGET_SYSTEM.md`
- `docs/migration/README.md`
- `docs/migration/09-implementation-tasklist.md`
- `docs/migration/10-environment-status.md`

For database or migration work, also read:
- `docs/migration/01-current-state.md`
- `docs/migration/04-master-data-definition.md`
- `docs/migration/05-schema-mapping.md`
- `docs/migration/07-reconciliation-plan.md`
- `docs/agent-rules/database.md`

## Detailed Rule Files

Read only the relevant detailed rule files for the task:

- Project config, MCP, skills, secrets: `docs/agent-rules/configuration.md`
- Database and Supabase environments: `docs/agent-rules/database.md`
- Active app, legacy source, migration priority, code organization: `docs/agent-rules/development.md`
- Forms, API payloads, syntax validation, master data list pattern: `docs/agent-rules/validation.md`
- Testing, browser QA, Playwright expectations: `docs/agent-rules/testing.md`
- Sub agent usage and close rules: `docs/agent-rules/sub-agents.md`
- Resumable checkpoint docs: `docs/agent-rules/session-handoff.md`
- Git and communication: `docs/agent-rules/git-communication.md`

## Project Goal

Improve the existing system so both code and database structure are correct, maintainable, and traceable while preserving current business flow as much as practical.

Do not treat this as a greenfield rewrite unless explicitly instructed.

## Current Environment Shortlist

- Active app: `apps/next/`
- Git remotes:
  - `new-origin` = active target repo `https://github.com/terner/new-ns-scrap-erp.git`
  - `origin` = old/legacy repo `https://github.com/sirimasth/ns-scrap-erp.git`
- Dev/target Supabase: `fhglqymcdmrgbsbadnwr`
- Legacy production/source Supabase: `mqsgptraslgpyzbpndlg` read-only
- Staging/UAT: not created yet
- New production: not created yet
- Project MCP config: `.mcp.json`
- Project skills: `.agents/skills/`
- Current work handoff: `docs/migration/00-current-work.md`

## Validation Baseline

For meaningful code changes, run validation proportional to risk. For the active Next app, prefer:

```bash
npm run lint --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next
npm run type-check --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next
npm run build --workspace @ns-scrap-erp/next
```

For docs-only changes, at minimum run:

```bash
git diff --check
```
